# A better way: Compilers

Then in the early 1950s, Grace Hopper proposed creating a programming language based on English with a “compiler” that would turn that code into  binary computer instructions.

She proceeded to create her own compiler and later helped design of some of the most important and influential early programming languages.

So instead of what we used to do, with programmers taking what someone wants to happen and figuring out the binary computer code themselves...

We now use an intermediate “programming language”.

In this class we will take ideas for programs written in English and translate them into Python code. The Python Interpreter will then translate this code into binary instructions, which the computer will then run.

Programmer must do three things
1. Break down problem into steps for a computer
1. Write those steps down in a programming language
1. Run compiler / interpreter
