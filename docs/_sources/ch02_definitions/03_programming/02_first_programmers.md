# Talking to Computers (the first programmers)

[diagram of english speaker and computer]

A person can come up with an English statement of what they want the computer to do.

> Person:
“Retweet all tweets that mention me.”

A computer runs instructions that are written in binary

> Computer:
“00101010100010101010010101011101010101101001010101001010001010101001010010101001010010010101010010101001”

Computers use binary (0s and 1s) to store:
- Information
- Instructions

First Programmers (1940s)

These programmers directly translated from english to binary

ENIAC: the first electronic general-purpose computer (1945)

Computers can do two things very quickly:
Arithmetic
2 + 2 = 4
Follow logical steps
When you press this button, then close the program
BUT…
This process is very tedious
