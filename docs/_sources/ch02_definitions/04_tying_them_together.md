# Tying It Together

Now that we have defined social media, ethics, and programming, we will spend the rest of this book tying them together in different ways.

To give one example, let's look at the experience of people who use social media but can't view images (they may be blind or low vision, or their device or internet might have restrictions). In order to make the information from the image accessible to these users, social media platforms allow images to be posted with an "alt text", which the user can read (or have the computer read to them). See {numref}`alt_text_fig` below for an example.

```{figure} alt_text_bigger.png
---
name: alt_text_fig
alt: 'a screenshot of a tweet by Kyle Thayer that has a photo. The tweet says: "We realized that some of our puzzles used the same mold, so now we can make combo dolphin / lighthouse puzzles! (Credit to artist Tim Klein who does this and I read about years ago: https://puzzlemontage.crevado.com)." The photo has the text "ALT" in the bottom left corner. The ALT button has been pressed, causing a popup to appear which shows the alt text: "Two circular puzzles one of a lighthouse and one of dolphins, except the pieces of a dolphin are swapped into place above the lighthouse."'

A [tweet](https://twitter.com/kylemthayer/status/1283516336845594624) with a photo that has an "alt text" (seen in the popup over the image), so those who cannot see the photo still have access to the information in the tweet.
```

Now, people who design and program social media platforms can do things to encourage or discourage users adding alt-text to their photos. For example, they could require or forbid users from adding alt-text to their photos, or they could do more subtle versions of those by putting reminders to add alt-text, or making the option of adding alt-text hard to find. Additioanlly, they could run a machine learning program to try to [automatically generate alt-text for photos](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/02/18/arts/alt-text-images-descriptions.html), though those programs may make mistakes or have biases.

So what are the ethical responsibilities of the designers and programmers of social media platforms?
