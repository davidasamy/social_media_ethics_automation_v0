# Social Media and “Real Life”
- One popular sentiment when we were young and on the Internet was:
  - “The internet isn’t real life.”
    - meaning what happened on the internet wasn't important
- Versions of this phrase still go around about social media, like this tweet from statistician Nate Silver
  - [![Nate Silver tweets: "Twitter is not real life part 69420", quote tweeting Harry Enten saying "Most of the polling indicated NYC'ers wanted Amazon in NYC. When tax breaks were mentioned, support did fall. But even with it mentioned, support was very strong in Queens." Tweet was post at 8:55 AM on February 14th, 2019.](twitter_not_real_life.png)](https://twitter.com/natesilver538/status/1096090507762167810)
    - this seems to mean that conversations and views represented on Twitter are not representative of most people
