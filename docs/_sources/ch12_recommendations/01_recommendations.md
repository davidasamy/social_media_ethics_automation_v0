# What Recommendation Algorithms Do

- Algorithm: A series of steps or rules (or a specific computer program) designed to achieve some goal.
  - A cooking recipe is an example of an algorithm
- Social media networks use algorithms to recommend various things to users of their platform, such as:
  - Posts
  - Friends / connections
  - Topics
  - Advertisements
  - Reminders

- Recommendations based on many different factors (many we talked about last time), such as:
  - Time since posting (e.g., show new posts, remind of posts _ years ago)
  - Friends/followers
  - Posts / likes
  - Which posts you click on or pause on
  - How people who are like you or are near you behave (they know approximately where you are)
  - Phone numbers, email addresses ([sometimes collected deceptively](https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/03/facebook-phone-number-look-up/))
- Social media recommendation algorithms are normally secret, and are modified regularly

## Reflections
- What experiences do you have of social media sites making particularly good recommendations for you?
- What experiences do you have of social media sites making particularly bad recommendations for you?
