# Healthy Activities on Social Media


## Finding Online Communities
- Safe-spaces for marginalized communities
  - [Trans Twitter and the beauty of online anonymity](https://www.vox.com/culture/21432987/trans-twitter-reddit-online-anonymity)
- Sharing about mental health
  - [Social Media Has Become A Place To Talk About Mental Illness. But Is That Helpful?](https://www.npr.org/2019/11/13/779015105/social-media-has-become-a-place-to-talk-about-mental-illness-but-is-that-helpful)
- Support groups, for example:
  - Private Facebook groups: [The ADHD Adult group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/778098019379268)
  - Reddit subreddits: [r/raisedbynarcissists](https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/)

If you are bullied at school (and by classmates on some social media platform), you might find a community online that supports you elsewhere online.
