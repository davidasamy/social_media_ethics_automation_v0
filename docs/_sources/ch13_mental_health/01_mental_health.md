## Social Media and Mental Health (particularly anxiety)

> “If [social media] was just bad, I'd just tell all the kids to throw their phone in the ocean, and it'd be really easy. The problem is it - we are hyper-connected, and we're lonely. We're overstimulated, and we're numb. We're expressing our self, and we're objectifying ourselves. So I think it just sort of widens and deepens the experiences of what kids are going through.
>
> But in regards to social anxiety, social anxiety - there's a part of social anxiety I think that feels like you're a little bit disassociated from yourself. And it's sort of like you're in a situation, but you're also floating above yourself, watching yourself in that situation, judging it. And social media literally is that. You know, it forces kids to not just live their experience but be nostalgic for their experience while they're living it, watch people watch them, watch people watch them watch them.
>
>My sort of impulse is like when the 13 year olds of today grow up to be social scientists, I'll be very curious to hear what they have to say about it. But until then, it just feels like we just need to gather the data.”

    - “People historically came to cosmetic surgeons with photos of celebrities whose features they hoped to emulate. Now, they’re coming with edited selfies. They want to bring to life the version of themselves that they curate through apps like FaceTune and Snapchat.”

## Unhealthy Activities on Social Media
- Doomscrolling
  - “Tendency to continue to surf or scroll through bad news, even though that news is saddening, disheartening, or depressing. Many people are finding themselves reading continuously bad news about COVID-19 without the ability to stop or step back.” - Merriam-Webster Dictionary
  - Comparable to the 24-hour news cycle
  - [![](doom_quality.png)](https://twitter.com/ethanjacobslaw/status/1347434641540538368)
- Munchausen by Internet
  - Pretending to have a disease, to for example, get sympathy or attention from an online support group
- Digital self-harm:
  - Self-Bullying
    - When Teens Cyberbully Themselves
  - Intentionally seeking out negative feedback
  - Communities formed on sharing and reinforcing their hopelessness and self-hatred

## Digital Self-Harm Example: Incels
- [Incels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incel): A toxic community of lonely, single men
  - “Incel” is short for “involuntarily celibate” meaning they are men who have centered their identity on wanting to have sex with women, but with no women “giving” them sex
  - “The Red Pill”:
    - only “Alpha” men (aka “Chads”) get sex from women, so learn how to be an Alpha
  - “The Black Pill”:
    - Your biology (e.g., skull shape) means no women will “give” you sex. You will be forever alone, without sex, and unhappy.
  - Incels view sex with women as a right, which is being “unfairly” withheld from them by women, Chads, and “feminism” (they are objectifying women and sex)
  - Often hatred and violence directed at themselves, as well as at others (women and “Chads”)
    - Incel community has produced multiple mass murderers / terrorists attacks

## Mental Health: Finding Online Communities

- Sharing about mental health

- Support groups, for example:

  - Reddit subreddits: [r/raisedbynarcissists](https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/)

## Class Discussion
- In what ways have you found social media bad for your mental health and good for your mental health?
- What responsibility do you think social media platforms have for the mental health of their users?
- Are there ways social media sites can be designed to be better for the mental health of its users?

## Programming
What goes here? Unrelated concept? I can move this lecture around as needed


Functions with named params and default values

https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_functions.asp
```
def function_name(arg_1 = "default"):
  # do various actions, like this:
  print("arg 1 will be default if not sent:" + arg_1)

# call function
    function_name()
    function_name(arg_1 = "a different value")
```


Function returns

- Functions can “return” a value, that is, a value comes back when the function is done, that can be used (e.g., stored in a variable). E.g.

```
message = "this is a test message"

how_long_message =      len(message)
```   
             <- Output (return)    <- Inputs (arguments, parameters)


- When writing a function, to return a value, use the word “return” followed by a value

```
def mult(num1, num2):
  return num1 * num2

# call function
    number_var = mult(3, 4)
```
