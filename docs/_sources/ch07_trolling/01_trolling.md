## Precursors of trolling
- Practical jokes, pranks, hazing, satire (e.g., [A Modest Proposal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Modest_Proposal))
- Fun at causing others pain:
  - “Boys throw stones at frogs in fun, but the frogs do not die in fun, but in earnest.”
[Bion of Borysthenes](https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Bion_of_Borysthenes) (c. 325 – c. 250 BC)
- [Bad Faith](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bad_faith)
  - Pretending to hold views or feelings, while not actually holding them (may be intentional, or may be through self-deception)
  - “Never believe that anti-Semites are completely unaware of the absurdity of their replies. They know that their remarks are frivolous, open to challenge. But they are amusing themselves, for it is their adversary who is obliged to use words responsibly, since he believes in words. The anti-Semites have the right to play. They even like to play with discourse for, by giving ridiculous reasons, they discredit the seriousness of their interlocutors. They delight in acting in bad faith, since they seek not to persuade by sound argument but to intimidate and disconcert. If you press them too closely, they will abruptly fall silent, loftily indicating by some phrase that the time for argument is past.”
    - [Jean-Paul Sartre - Written in Paris just after it was liberated from Nazi control](https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Jean-Paul_Sartre#Anti-Semite_and_Jew_(1945))

  - Who could benefit?
- What are potential harms?
  - Who could be harmed?

## Responding to trolls?
- “Don’t feed the trolls”
- A counter opinion:
  - https://www.theverge.com/2018/7/12/17561768/dont-feed-the-trolls-online-harassment-abuse
  - [Don’t feed the trolls] became the mantra of how to ignore online abuse completely.
  - [Not feeding the trolls doesn’t work] Ask anyone who has dealt with persistent harassment online, especially women: this is not usually what happens. Instead, the harasser keeps pushing and pushing to get the reaction they want with even more tenacity and intensity. It’s the same pattern on display in the litany of abusers and stalkers, both online and off, who escalate to more dangerous and threatening behavior when they feel like they are being ignored.
  - “Don’t feed the trolls” also ignores an obvious method for addressing online abuse: skilled moderation and the willingness to kick people off platforms for violating rules about abuse.
  - The biggest mistake we ever made with trolls was making the question of abuse about how to placate and fix [the trolls] instead of how to empower the people they hurt or manage your own well-being in the face of them.
