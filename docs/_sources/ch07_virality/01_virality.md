## Evolution
First, an overview of evolution
- Evolution occurs when these three conditions are present
  - Replication (with Inheritance)
    - An organism can make a new copy of itself, which inherits its characteristics
  - Variations / Mutations
    - The characteristics of an organism are sometimes changed, in a way that can be inherited by future copies
  - Natural Selection
    - Some characteristics make it more or less likely for an organism to compete for resources, survive, and make copies of itself
- When those three conditions are present, the over time organisms
  - Adapt to their environment
  - Diversify
  - Develop strategies for competing with or cooperating with other organisms.

## Memes
- [The Selfish Gene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Selfish_Gene) by Richard Dawkins (1976)
 - Genes: a section or sections of DNA that perform a function and are inherited
 - Considered evolution in terms of natural selection of genes, instead of natural selection of organism
   - If a bees genes cause it to sting and die to protect its nest (that shares those genes), then those genes reproduce.
 - Also coined word “meme” to refer to a piece of culture that might reproduce in an evolutionary fashion. For example, a hummable tune
- Memes
  - Any piece of human culture can be considered as a meme that is spreading (or not) according to evolutionary forces, such as:
    - Technology (languages, weapons, medicine, writing, math, computers, etc.), religions, philosophies, political ideas (democracy, authoritarianism, etc.), music, art, organizations, etc.

## Pre-internet Virality Examples

- Books
  - Before the printing press, if you wanted a copy of a book, you had to find someone with a copy and then have a scribe make a copy of it for you
- Chain letters
  - To copy, you had to go to a store to photocopy them, or use a typewriter to retype it. Then you had to pay for envelopes and stamps to mail it.
  - [![Type-written written chain letter, excerpt below](chain_letter.png)](https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~mli/chain.html)
    - “You will receive good luck within four days of receiving this letter, providing, you in turn send it on. [...] An RAF officer received $70,000 [...] Gene Walsh lost his wife six days after receiving the letter. He failed to circulate the letter.”
- Sourdough starters
  - Sourdough starters be grown and split into more starters that can be shared with friends
  - [Carl Griffith's sourdough starter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Griffith%27s_sourdough_starter) dates back to at least 1847
  - ![](sourdough_starter.png) ![](sourdough_bread.png)


## Natural selection in social media
- Replication (with inheritance) examples
  - In system: Like, retweet, quote tweet, reply, subtweet
  - Remove from system: screenshot, download, cross-post (to different site), copy without attribution
  - Modify (see below) and post
- Variations / Mutations
  - Modify text, Screenshot, change text, Photoshop, subtweet, add to and repost, etc.
- Selection
  - Human decisions to engage/replicate
    - Based on reactions like “that’s funny!” or “that’s horrible” or “I have a great comeback to that!” or “re-posting this will make me look smart!”, etc.
  - Algorithm decisions to put in people’s feeds, or list as trending
  - Organizations decide to highlight social media phenomenon (e.g., news organizations)

## Examples of virality

Viral for being “bad” or embarrassing
- “Star Wars Kid” (15 year old)
  - “On November 2nd, 2002, Raza recorded an 8mm movie of himself pretend-fighting with a club in his high school studio, but forgot to take the cassette tape home with him. Unbeknownst to Raza, the footage was eventually discovered by three of his classmates and posted online via Kazaa, a popular P2P file-sharing network, on April 14th, 2003.”
  - ![](star_wars_kid.png)
- Rebecca Black - Friday (13 year old)
  - uploaded to YouTube on February 10th, 2011
  - “As of March 30th, 2011, Rebecca Black's "Friday" YouTube video officially surpassed Justin Bieber's "Baby" in total number of user downvotes with over 1.1 million downvotes.”

- “Bean Dad”
 - John Roderick posted twitter thread on Jan. 2, 2021
9-year-old daughter was hungry and had asked him to open a can of beans
  - He told her to figure out how to use the can-opener herself and refused to help her
    - ![Tweet by @johnroderick: I said, "The tool is made to be pleasing but it doesn't have any superfluous qualities. Everything that moves does so for a reason." She said, "I hate you." I'm sure she believes that she does. I said "You understand everything except how the tool addresses the can." She sighed.](bean_dad.png)
  - Six hours later she finally figured out how to open the can
  - “While Roderick tweeted the story as though it were a proud parenting moment, many criticized the story for teaching poor lessons to the daughter with some going so far as to call it abuse and others made jokes about the story.”
  - In response to this story one twitter user posted this: ![Tweet by @maplecocaine: Each day on twitter there is one main character. The goal is to never be it](main_character.png) and now "the main character of the day on twitter" is a common phrase.
- Intentionally “bad” or “offensive”
  - Overlaps with trolling
  - The cooking videos
  - Politicians and political commentators (see also part of [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gq0ZHgKT2tc&t=345s))

## Uneven contributions of users
- Spikey / Long Tail / Lurker
- In most social media networks, most content is generated by a small percentage of users
  - Nearly All of Wikipedia Is Written By Just 1 Percent of Its Editors
  - On StackOverflow “A 2013 study has found that 75% of users only ask one question, 65% only answer one question, and only 8% of users answer more than 5 questions.”

## Context Collapse
- [What's 'Context Collapse'? Understanding it Can Mean a More Fulfilling Online Life](https://www.rewire.org/context-collapse-online)
- Different audiences viewing the same info / posts / persona (where normally, you might act or share differently in different groups
- Can be inherent in the sharing (e.g., you are “friends” on facebook with family, coworkers, friends, etc.)
- Can also involve content shared in one location being shared elsewhere (a different audience than the original one)


## The Experience of Going Viral
- Many people who have gone viral online have mixed feelings about it
  - [What it Feels Like to Go Viral](https://psmag.com/economics/going-viral-is-like-doing-cartwheels-on-the-water-spout-of-a-giant-whale)
    - “Content going viral is overwhelming, intimidating, exciting, and downright scary” - Roxane Gay
  - [Accidentally famous: The psychology of going viral](https://www.cnn.com/2018/03/16/health/social-media-fame/index.html)

## Aside on “Cancel Culture”
- It seems to me that the term “cancel culture” is used to mean a number of different things.
  - For offenses ranging from a minor statement that offends some group, to sexual assault of minors (e.g., R. Kelly, Woody Allen, Kevin Spacey)
  - Facing a range of consequences like:
    - Celebrity losing  an audience (which may be their livelihood)
    - Public criticism of a comment or action
    - Harassment of a person for a comment  or action
    - Loss of jobs
    - Rejection of an apology or of a non-apology (e.g., I’m sorry if you were offended)
- Rather than discuss “cancel culture” as a single thing, we will cover it in pieces:
