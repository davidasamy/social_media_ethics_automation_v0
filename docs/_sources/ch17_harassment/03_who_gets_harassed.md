## Moderation and Violence
You might remember from Chapter 14 that social contracts, whether literal or metaphorical, involve groups of people all accepting limits to their freedoms. Because of this, some philosophers say that a state or nation is, fundamentally, violent. Violence in this case refers to the way that individual Natural Rights and freedoms are _violated_ by external social constraints. This kind of violence is considered to be _legitimated_ by the agreement to the social contract. This might be easier to understand if you imagine a medical scenario.

  - Say you have broken a bone and you are in pain. A doctor might say that the bone needs to be set; this will be painful, and kind of a forceful, "violent" action in which someone is interfering with your body in a painful way. So the doctor asks if you agree to let her set the bone. You agree, and so the doctor's action is construed as being a legitimate interference with your body and your freedom.

  - If someone random just walked up to you and started pulling at the injured limb, this unagreed violence would not be considered legitimate. Likewise, when medical practitioners interfere with a patient's body in a way that is non-consensual or not what the patient agreed to, then the violence is considered illegitimate, or morally bad.

We tend to think of violence as being another "normatively loaded" word, like authenticity. But where authenticity is usually loaded with a positive connotation--on the whole, people often value authenticity as a good thing--violence is loaded with a negative connotation. Yes, the doctor setting the bone is violent and invasive, but we don't usually call this "violence" because it is considered to be a legitimate exercise of violence. Instead, we reserve the term "violence" mostly for describing forms of interference that we consider to be morally bad.

## A Bit of History

In much of mainstream Western thought, the individual's right to freedom is taken as a supreme moral good, and so anything that is viewed as an illegitimate interference with that individual freedom is considered violence or violation. In the founding of the United States, one thing on people's minds was the way that in a Britain riddled with factions and disagreement, people of one subgroup could not speak freely when another subgroup was in power. This case was unusual because instead of one group being consistently dominant, the Catholic and Protestant communities alternated between being dominant and being oppressed. So the United States wanted to reinforce what they saw as the value of individual freedoms by writing it into the formal, explicit part of our social contract. Thus, we got the famous First Amendment to the Constitution, saying that individuals' right to freely express themselves in speech, in their religion, in their gatherings, and so on could not legally be interfered with.

Kymlicka on why utilitariansim stopped helping... counting each person as one helped get other people included in the count. But counting people as one obscures the magnitude or significance of variations in levels of wellbeing.

This gets a bit more complicated though, as some kinds of uses of speech are legally proscribed. But this means that it is a legally defined category on the basis of which one can sue, taking the offender to court... they were free to say what they wanted, but where that speech caused substantial damages, the offending party is expected to compensate or pay for the damage done. So people are still free to say what they want, but doing so can, in some cases, come with consequences that are legally enforceable via the courts.

What about all the other sorts of harms that can come from the way people choose to exercise their freedom of speech? Words can be used to hurt people, and in social media spaces it is sadly not uncommon to see people deploying consistent, recurring patterns of hurtful speech against others. And while they are legally allowed to do this, the consequences are real for the ones being hurt.

## What is Harrassment viz. Ethics/Norms
also... grassroots 'moderation' as in ways of kicking people out of your house. Hermeneutic injustice but not by that name. Who gets harrassed: take a look at the power structures. Everybody counts as one.
