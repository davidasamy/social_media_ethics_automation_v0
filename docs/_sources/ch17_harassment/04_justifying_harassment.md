# Justifying Harassment

- [Morally Motivated Networked Harassment as Normative Reinforcement](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/20563051211021378)
  - “Perpetrators of harassment often believe their actions are justified.”
  - “Networked harassment typically begins by **identifying** one or more norm violations (**the accusation**) and tying it to a specific person, brand, or organization (**the target**), together creating a **justification for harassment**.
  - This accusation is **promoted** by one or many key accounts or network nodes, such as highly followed social media accounts or influencers (**the amplifier**). Often, but not always, the amplifier is in a different social network than the target.
  - Members of the amplifiers’ networked **audience**, who share an ideological or moral framework, individually **send ad hominem attacks**, insults, slurs, and in the worst cases, threats of death, rape, and violence to the accused (brigading, dogpiling, or “calling out”).
  - Individual **targets typically experience stress**, depression, and other psychological harms, frequently resulting in **self-censorship and withdrawal** from social media participation. Simultaneously, the ideological consensus of the accusing network is reinforced through a common enemy and the symbolic boundaries between contexts are reinforced.
  - Thus, harassment becomes a regulating force in which **speech is removed from the public sphere**.”

## Reflection Questions
- Are there times where you think crowd harassment is justified?
- Do you feel differently about crowd harassment if the target is rich, famous, powerful (e.g., a politician)?
