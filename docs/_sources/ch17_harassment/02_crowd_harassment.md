# Crowd Harassment
Harassment can also be done through crowds. Crowd harassment has also always been a part of culture, such as riots, mob violence, revolts, revolution, government persecution, etc.

Social media then allows new ways for crowd harassment to occur.

Crowd harassment includes all the forms of individual harasmment (but done by a group of people), plus things like:
- Dogpilling: TODO: define
- Public Shaming (this will be our next chapter)
- [Stochastic terrorism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lone_wolf_attack#Stochastic_terrorism)
  - [The use of mass public communication, usually against a particular individual or group, which incites or inspires acts of terrorism which are statistically probable but happen seemingly at random.](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/stochastic_terrorism)
- Cross-platform raids (e.g., 4chan group planning harassment on another platform)

In addition, fake crowds (e.g., bots or people paid to post) can participate in crowd harassment. For example:
> “The majority of the hate and misinformation about [Meghan Markle and Prince Henry] originated from a small group of accounts whose primary, if not sole, purpose appears to be to tweet negatively about them. [...] 83 accounts are responsible for 70% of the negative hate content targeting the couple on Twitter.”
