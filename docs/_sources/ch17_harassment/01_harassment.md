### Discussion

## Crowd Harassment
- In-person crowd harassment has always been part of human cultures. For example: riots, mob violence, revolts, revolutions, oppression, government persecution (like the [FBI trying to convince MLK to commit suicide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FBI%E2%80%93King_suicide_letter))
- Social media allows for new ways of organizing and performing crowd harassment

## Question

Do you believe crowd harassment is ever justified?

## Justifying Harassment?

- [Morally Motivated Networked Harassment as Normative Reinforcement](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/20563051211021378)
  - “Perpetrators of harassment often believe their actions are justified.”
  - “Networked harassment typically begins by **identifying** one or more norm violations (**the accusation**) and tying it to a specific person, brand, or organization (**the target**), together creating a **justification for harassment**.
  - This accusation is **promoted** by one or many key accounts or network nodes, such as highly followed social media accounts or influencers (**the amplifier**). Often, but not always, the amplifier is in a different social network than the target.
  - Members of the amplifiers’ networked **audience**, who share an ideological or moral framework, individually **send ad hominem attacks**, insults, slurs, and in the worst cases, threats of death, rape, and violence to the accused (brigading, dogpiling, or “calling out”).
  - Individual **targets typically experience stress**, depression, and other psychological harms, frequently resulting in **self-censorship and withdrawal** from social media participation. Simultaneously, the ideological consensus of the accusing network is reinforced through a common enemy and the symbolic boundaries between contexts are reinforced.
  - Thus, harassment becomes a regulating force in which **speech is removed from the public sphere**.”

  - “Facebook page titled ‘Shame Lion Killer Dr. Walter Palmer and River Bluff Dental’ drew thousands”

- [Gamergate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamergate_(harassment_campaign))
  - Justified by various false claims (e.g., journalistic malpractice), but mostly motivated by either outright misogyny or feeling threatened by critiques of games/gaming culture from a not straight-white-male viewpoint.
