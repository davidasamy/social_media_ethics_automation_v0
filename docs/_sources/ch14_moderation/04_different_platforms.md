# Comparing Different Platforms
- 4chan/8chan - minimal moderation
  - Though the do moderate for spam!
- Reddit - different moderators in each subreddit, some very toxic, others not
  - [Study finds Reddit’s controversial ban of its most toxic subreddits actually worked](https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/11/study-finds-reddits-controversial-ban-of-its-most-toxic-subreddits-actually-worked/)
    - “Reddit finally banned a handful of its most hateful and deplorable subreddits, including r/coontown and r/fatpeoplehate.”
    - “Post-ban, hate speech by the same users was reduced by as much as 80-90 percent.”
    - “Members of banned communities left Reddit at significantly higher rates than control groups.”
    - “Migration was common, both to similar subreddits (i.e. overtly racist ones) and tangentially related ones (r/The_Donald).”
    - “However, within those communities, hate speech did not reliably increase, although there were slight bumps as the invaders encountered and tested new rules and moderators.”

- Public Figure Exception?
- Facebook
  - https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/03/11/1020600/facebook-responsible-ai-misinformation/
    - “The more likely a post is to violate Facebook’s community standards, the more user engagement it receives, because the algorithms that maximize engagement reward inflammatory content.”
- Political Leaders Exception
  - Twitter/Facebook/etc. Had an [exception to their normal moderation policies for political leaders](https://help.twitter.com/en/rules-and-policies/public-interest), where they wouldn’t ban them even if they violated site policies (most notably applied to Donald Trump)
  - These policies changed some when Donald Trump was banned from Twitter and then Facebook after the January 6th Insurrection
