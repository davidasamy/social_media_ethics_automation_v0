# Imagining Alternatives

Different ways online social media could work

Are these alternatives good ideas? ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯


Try to work out how these alternatives might work

- What if social media sites were governed by their users instead of by shareholders?
  - How would users participate in decision making?
  - Would non-users have a say (e.g., if the whole user base decides to harass a group of non-users)?
  - How do you think the sites would work differently?
- What if social media sites were created in other countries and cultures?
  - What different values would be embedded and what would that look like?
  - For example, many cultures value family connections much more than white Americans do, but current American social media sites do not emphasize them.
