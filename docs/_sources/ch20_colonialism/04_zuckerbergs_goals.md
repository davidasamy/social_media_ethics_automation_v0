# Mark Zuckerberg’s “Benevolent” Goals
- Old mission statement was “making the world more open and connected”
  - Do users want the connection that Mark Zuckerberg is offering?
  - People did sign up, it helps people access resources, people wanted to be connected to the online world like everyone else was (see the [Time article](https://time.com/facebook-world-plan/))
  - But just connecting everyone isn’t necessarily a good thing
  - From Sci-Fi novel The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy by Douglas Adams (1979)
    - “[I]f you stick a Babel fish in your ear you can instantly understand anything said to you in any form of language. [...] Meanwhile, the poor Babel fish, by effectively removing all barriers to communication between different races and cultures, has caused more and bloodier wars than anything else in the history of creation.”
- Meta changed motto after “connecting the world” went poorly (e.g., [genocide](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2021/dec/06/rohingya-sue-facebook-myanmar-genocide-us-uk-legal-action-social-media-violence), [insurrection](https://www.propublica.org/article/facebook-hosted-surge-of-misinformation-and-insurrection-threats-in-months-leading-up-to-jan-6-attack-records-show))
  - “I used to think that if we just gave people a voice and helped them connect, that would make the world better by itself. In many ways it has. But our society is still divided. Now I believe we have a responsibility to do even more. It's not enough to simply connect the world, we must also work to bring the world closer together.” [Mark Zuckerberg, March 15, 2021](https://www.facebook.com/notes/393134628500376/)
