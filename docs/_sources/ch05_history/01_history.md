# History of Social Media

Note: This is a mix of history and money strategies, the second part probably fits better in Capitalism later, though covered just enough for now. Or does capitalism come sooner?

## Homework Due (put in appendix?)
- Pick a social media platform (current or defunct) and write something about it (history, users, famous incidents, etc.). [Here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_social_networking_services) is a list to start with.
- Readings
  - Watch a [clip](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k5fJmkv02is) from the movie The Social Network
  - Read a US [Federal Trade Commission](https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2021/08/ftc-alleges-facebook-resorted-illegal-buy-or-bury-scheme-crush) complaint on Facebook
  - Read [The Rise and Fall of MySpace](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2011/01/the-rise-and-fall-of-myspace/69444/) on The Atlantic
  - Reflect on the strategies social media companies use to make money, and what gets in the way.

## Web 2.0

## What attracts people to social media?
- What are your ideas?
- A few of mine
  - Sharing with friends, experience archive, persona creation, idea sharing, etc.
  - Making money through sponsors, ads, being an influencer

## How does social media work?
- Money
  - Ads
  - User data (the user is the product)
  - Specialized access
- Fears
  - Competition (off and online) or loss of popularity
  - Regulation
- Network Effect / Network Power
- Centralized vs. Decentralized?
  - Mastadon and Nazis: https://www.theverge.com/platform/amp/2019/7/12/20691957/mastodon-decentralized-social-network-gab-migration-fediverse-app-blocking
- “Frictionless” interfaces

## Discussion Questions
- Where do the goals of social media companies align with the goals of social media users?
- Where do the goals of social media companies not align with the goals of social media users


## Programming
NOTE: Hard to tie any programming specifically to this topic

Lists and basic for loops? I guess??

## Design activity:
compare interfaces of two social media sites. (provide some historical examples too) What does each emphasize and make easiest (friction)
