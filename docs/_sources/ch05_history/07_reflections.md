# Reflection Activities


- Pick a social media platform (current or defunct) and learn something about it (history, users, famous incidents, etc.). [Here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_social_networking_services) is a list to start with.

- Where do the goals of social media companies align with the goals of social media users?
- Where do the goals of social media companies not align with the goals of social media users

- Compare interfaces of two social media sites. (provide some historical examples too) What does each emphasize and make easiest (friction)
