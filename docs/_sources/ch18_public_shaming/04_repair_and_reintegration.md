# Repair and Reintegration

The idea of repair (or reconciliation) has shown up a couple times already, both in the role of shame in child development, and in the [Enforcing Social Norms: The Morality of Public Shaming](https://philpapers.org/archive/BILESN.pdf) paper.

Let's look more at what a repair might look like.

In the article [Famous abusers seek easy forgiveness. Rosh Hashanah teaches us repentance is hard.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/famous-abusers-seek-easy-forgiveness-rosh-hashanah-teaches-us-repentance-is-hard/2018/09/06/c2dc2cac-b0ab-11e8-9a6a-565d92a3585d_story.html) by Rabbi Danya Ruttenberg, she outlines a set of steps for "repentance" needed for someone to have their relationship with others repaired:

1. “The bad actor must **own the harm** perpetrated, ideally publicly”
1. “They must do the hard internal work to **become the kind of person who does not harm in this way** — which is a massive undertaking, demanding tremendous introspection and confrontation of unpleasant aspects of the self”
1. “They must **make restitution for harm done**, in whatever way that might be possible”
1. “Then — and only then — they must **apologize sincerely to the victim**”
1. “Lastly, **the next time** they are confronted with the opportunity to commit a similar misdeed, they must **make a different, better choice**”


## Repair Example

On February 6, 2022, Jeremy Schneider became the Twitter "main character of the day" for posting the following Tweet, which was widely condemned as being mean and not understanding of other people's experiences:

```

In what was an unusual turn of events for a Twitter "main character of the day," Jeremy Schneider later made an apology that was mostly accepted by the Twitter users who had criticized his Tweet:

alt: "After three days of reflecting on this tweet and an evening spent reading at a bar, I have some thoughts. First off, this tweet was mean. Uncharacteristically mean. “Nobody likes you?” I don’t talk like that in real life, why would I tweet that? And saying it to people minding their own business reading a book? Yeah, that’s mean. I’m sorry. I'm glad I tried reading in the bar, I still don’t quite get it. I struggle to read if I don’t have quiet. That doesn’t mean other people don’t like it. I always say “don’t yuck somebody else’s yum,” why should I yuck somebody else’s bar behavior when it isn’t affecting me? I once had a friend tell me he brought a book to the bar to pick up girls. It was the most insufferable thing I have ever heard. I started seeing men reading at the bar through that lens. I thought they were being was conspicuous and pretentious. I was being presumptuous. Many pointed out that some people bring books to bars to ward off unwanted conversation or advances. This is not something I had considered. I’m especially ashamed I overlooked this. "

alt: "I love reading! This tweet somehow became construed as an attack on reading. If it weren’t for reading, I wouldn’t have a job. And I love books! I’d like to write one one day! I just prefer to read them in quiet places. This 77-character tweet made me The Main Character on Twitter, and it sucked. I was Brandon Knight, Twitter was DeAndre Jordan. My mean tweet was met with some funny tweets and lots of mean tweets. That sucked. I asked for it, but it sucked. Tweeting from the hip has served me well. People know me for my irreverent observational non sequiturs,  food pics, Marvel takes and love of the film Armageddon. I was trying to be funny. I clearly missed the mark. I’ll be thinking a little harder before I hit send from now on. So please know, if you’re someone who brings a book to the bar... people like you fine. In fact, you have numbers. And they’re ready to back you up on the internet. And if someone ever writes a book about the worst Twitter draggings of all time, I’ll be happy to sign your copy, right on the chapter about me.  I promise I won’t tweet about you if I see you reading it at a bar."
