## Shame vs. Guilt in childhood development
- Childhood development (article you read: [Trauma and Shame](https://www.oohctoolbox.org.au/trauma-and-shame))
  - Shame: “I am bad”
    - Hide/ostracized
  - Guilt: “This specific action I did was bad”
    - Wants to repair
  - A good parent will tell their child to stop a bad action,
    - the child may feel shame,
    - the parent will then comfort the child, letting them know it was the action that was the problem, but the child is not bad and the relationship is not in danger.
    - The child learns to feel guilt (and seek repair) instead of shame (and try to hide)
- Are there cultural differences with shame and guilt?
Are there other definitions and was of conceptualizing shame and guilt?
  - Is this guilt view individualistic and [more common in individualistic cultures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guilt%E2%80%93shame%E2%80%93fear_spectrum_of_cultures)?
  - E.g., how does this relate to the concept of “[face](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Face_(sociological_concept))” in other cultures?

## The ethics of public shaming - perspectives
- [Morally Motivated Networked Harassment as Normative Reinforcement](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/20563051211021378)   (from last time)
  - Identify the target who violated a community norm
  - Amplifier promotes story to their social network (often different than target’s network)
  - Amplifiers’ audience attacks the target
  - Target experiences negativity, frequently self-censors and withdraws. Simultaneously, the amplifiers’ network reinforces their values.
  - Speech is removed from the public sphere
- [Jennifer Jacquet: ‘The power of shame is that it can be used by the weak against the strong’](https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/mar/06/is-shame-necessary-review)
  - “The real power of shame is it can scale. It can work against entire countries and can be used by the weak against the strong. Guilt, on the other hand, because it operates entirely within individual psychology, doesn’t scale.”
  - “We still care about individual rights and protection. Transgressions that have a clear impact on broader society – like environmental pollution – and transgressions for which there is no obvious formal route to punishment are, for instance, more amenable to its use. It should be reserved for bad behaviour that affects most or all of us.”
  - “A good rule of thumb is to go after groups, but I don’t exempt individuals, especially not if they are politically powerful or sizeably impact society. But we must ask ourselves about the way those individuals are shamed and whether the punishment is proportional.”
- [Nation Demands Fresh Celebrity Meat - The Onion](https://www.theonion.com/nation-demands-fresh-celebrity-meat-1819571041)
  - Satirized public shaming as fulfilling the desire to
    - “to put on a pedestal, worship, envy, download sex tapes of, and then topple and completely destroy.”
    - Satirizes public shaming as entertainment and objectification
  - Schadenfreude: [enjoyment obtained from the troubles of others](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/schadenfreude)
  - Note that this article from 2009 is focusing on “celebrities,” but as the comedian Bo Burnham argues:
    - “[This] celebrity pressure I had experienced on stage has now been democratized and given to everybody [through social media]. And everyone is feeling this pressure of having an audience, of having to perform, of having a sort of, like, proper noun version of your own name and then the self in your heart.” ([NPR Fresh Air Interview](https://www.npr.org/transcripts/630069876))
- [Stop canceling normal people who go viral](https://www.vox.com/the-goods/22716772/west-elm-caleb-couch-guy-tiktok-cancel)
  - “Millions of people became invested in this (niche! not very interesting!) drama because it gives us something easy to be angry or curious or self-righteous about, something to project our own experiences onto, and thereby contributing even more content to the growing avalanche. Naturally, some decided to go look up the central character’s address, phone number, and workplace and share it on the internet.”
  - “‘It’s on social media, so it’s public!’ one could argue as a case for people’s right to act like forensic analysts on social media, and that is true. But this justification is typically valid when a) the person posting is someone of note, like a celebrity or a politician, and b) when the stakes are even a little bit high. In most cases of normal-person canceling, neither standard is met. Instead, it’s mob justice and vigilante detective work typically reserved for, say, unmasking the Zodiac killer, except weaponized against normal people.”
  - “Platforms like TikTok, where even people with few or no followers often go viral overnight, expedite the shaming process.”
- [Enforcing Social Norms: The Morality of Public Shaming](https://philpapers.org/archive/BILESN.pdf)
  - Different motivations
    - “Actions aimed at inducing shame”
    - “[S]eeking to draw attention to a social norm violation, and to rally others to their cause. They may or may not also be aiming to induce shame.” (they focus on this and count it as “public shaming”)
  - Constraints on moral public shaming
    - Proportionality: negative consequences not worse than the positive consequences
    - Necessity: not another more effective method of achieving goal
    - Respect for Privacy
    - Non-Abusiveness
    - Reintegration:
      - “Public shaming must aim at, and make possible, the reintegration of the norm violator back into the community, rather than permanently stigmatizing them.”


## Discussion questions
- What do you consider to be the most important factors in making an instance of public shaming bad?
- What do you consider to be the most important factors in making an instance of public shaming good (if you think that is possible)?

## Repair / Reintegration
- [Enforcing Social Norms: The Morality of Public Shaming](https://philpapers.org/archive/BILESN.pdf)
  - “Public shaming must aim at, and make possible, the reintegration of the norm violator back into the community, rather than permanently stigmatizing them.”
- [Famous abusers seek easy forgiveness. Rosh Hashanah teaches us repentance is hard. By Danya Ruttenberg](https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/famous-abusers-seek-easy-forgiveness-rosh-hashanah-teaches-us-repentance-is-hard/2018/09/06/c2dc2cac-b0ab-11e8-9a6a-565d92a3585d_story.html)
  - What is needed for repentance and repair?
    1. “The bad actor must **own the harm** perpetrated, ideally publicly”
    1. “They must do the hard internal work to **become the kind of person who does not harm in this way** — which is a massive undertaking, demanding tremendous introspection and confrontation of unpleasant aspects of the self”
    1. “They must **make restitution for harm done**, in whatever way that might be possible”
    1. “Then — and only then — they must **apologize sincerely to the victim**”
    1. “Lastly, **the next time** they are confronted with the opportunity to commit a similar misdeed, they must **make a different, better choice**”

## Repair Example

- A tweet making fun of people who read books at bars
Widely commented on and condemned on twitter (the “main character of the day”)
  - ![](book_tweet.png)
- In an unusual outcome to these types of events: three days later, the person gave an apology that was mostly accepted by twitter users as a good apology
  - ![](book_tweet_apology_1.png)
  - ![](book_tweet_apology_2.png)
  - TODO: Mark the steps of repentance and repair (done in slide)

## Discussion questions?
- Pick a situation where someone is being publicly shamed. Who is responsible for accepting or rejecting their apology/repentance?
- Pick a social media platform and a situation where someone is being publicly shamed. What might that person do to try to repair or reintegrate after the public shaming?
- Pick a social media platform. In what ways does that platform make it difficult to repair or reintegrate after public shaming?

## Design exercise

In a group
[![](retract_button_request.png)](https://twitter.com/katestarbird/status/928521450071273472)
Design a feature for twitter that allows users to retract a tweet as an alternative to deleting a tweet.

- How would a user do the retraction? What options would they have (e.g., can they choose to keep or delete the original tweet content)? What additional information would they be able to provide?
- How would that retracted tweet look when viewed?
- How would that retracted tweet look when it is part of a retweet or quote tweet?
- Would there be any notifications sent when a tweet is retracted?
- Outline 3 different examples of how and when a user might retract a tweet
  - E.g., misinformation, regret bad idea, regret mean tone, etc.
