## Nuances of Authenticity

  - “Calls to action”
  - business models
  - Emotional Labor / maintaining an affect
  - the “Youtube algorithm”
- Persona / Brand
  - We all act in different ways in different groups / situations

## Authenticity and Anonymity
- Does anonymity encourage / discourage authenticity?
  - Anonymity can encourage inauthentic behavior
    - You can pretend to be someone you are not
    - Your actions can’t be traced back to you (maybe)
  - Anonymity can encourage authentic behavior
    - You can express things about yourself you are not allowed to express in normal life
    - You can avoid negative reactions to your authentic self-expression
- Is authenticity good?
  - What authentic thing about yourself are you expressing?
    - Cruelty? Hate?

## Programming
- Getting info about tweets
  - Trump Tweets different between iPhone and Android
    - “My analysis ... concludes that the Android and iPhone tweets are clearly from different people, “posting during different times of day and using hashtags, links, and retweets in distinct ways,
    - “What’s more, we can see that the Android tweets are angrier and more negative, while the iPhone tweets tend to be benign announcements and pictures. .... this lets us tell the difference between the campaign’s tweets (iPhone) and Trump’s own (Android).”
