# Types of Content Moderator Set-Ups

- No moderators:
  - If users canâ€™t modify anything on your website, this works great! (e.g., personal web pages)
  - If they can, and the wrong people discover it, then you can get in trouble for allowing illegal things to stay up on your site
- Automated moderators / bots
- Personal moderation of your own space/device
  - E.g., blocking numbers on your phone, deleting things off your facebook wall, deleting comments off your youtube video
- Volunteer (free) moderation of a group from the community
  - E.g., Facebook groups, reddit subreddits, wikipedia, etc.
- Untrained staff at company (when they start a site and suddenly realize they have to moderate)
- Dedicated moderation teams
