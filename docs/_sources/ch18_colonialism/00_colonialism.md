# Colonialism

## Mark Zuckerberg’s “benevolent” goals
- Old mission statement was “making the world more open and connected”
  - Do users want the connection that Mark Zuckerberg is offering?
  - People did sign up, it helps people access resources, people wanted to be connected to the online world like everyone else was (see the [Time article](https://time.com/facebook-world-plan/))
  - But just connecting everyone isn’t necessarily a good thing
  - From Sci-Fi novel The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy by Douglas Adams (1979)
    - “[I]f you stick a Babel fish in your ear you can instantly understand anything said to you in any form of language. [...] Meanwhile, the poor Babel fish, by effectively removing all barriers to communication between different races and cultures, has caused more and bloodier wars than anything else in the history of creation.”
- Meta changed motto after “connecting the world” went poorly (e.g., [genocide](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2021/dec/06/rohingya-sue-facebook-myanmar-genocide-us-uk-legal-action-social-media-violence), [insurrection](https://www.propublica.org/article/facebook-hosted-surge-of-misinformation-and-insurrection-threats-in-months-leading-up-to-jan-6-attack-records-show))
  - “I used to think that if we just gave people a voice and helped them connect, that would make the world better by itself. In many ways it has. But our society is still divided. Now I believe we have a responsibility to do even more. It's not enough to simply connect the world, we must also work to bring the world closer together.” [Mark Zuckerberg, March 15, 2021](https://www.facebook.com/notes/393134628500376/)

## TODO: Link to ethics page on colonialism? also maybe resumarize here?

## “[White Saviors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_savior)”
- A sarcastic term for white people being seen as liberating or rescuing “helpless” non-white people
- Common in movies and TV.
- See TVTropes entries on [Mighty Whitey](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MightyWhitey), and [White Man’s Burden](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhiteMansBurden), which list movies like: James Cameron’s Avatar, Dances with Wolves, The Last Samuri (starring Tom Cruise), The Blind Side, The Help, La La Land, etc.

## Colonialism in Tech
- Silicon Valley Centralization
  - Software companies are based in Silicon valley in California, but their users live around the world
  - See book: [Coding places : software practice in a South American city](https://alliance-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/permalink/f/kjtuig/CP71113610430001451)
- [One Laptop Per Child](https://www.theverge.com/2018/4/16/17233946/olpcs-100-laptop-education-where-is-it-now):
  - “In late 2005, tech visionary and MIT Media Lab founder Nicholas Negroponte [introduced a] $100 laptop would have all the features of an ordinary computer but require so little electricity that a child could power it with a hand crank”
  - He wanted to give every child in the world a laptop, so they could learn computers
  - But…
    - It didn’t work well (hand-powered generator unreliable, screen to small to read)
    - It didn’t come with very good instructions
    - It wasn’t designed for what kids around the world would actually want (no input from actual kids around the world, just what the project leaders guessed would be wanted)
    - Project failed

## Colonialism and Meta’s Strategy
- Putting Meta’s Strategy in terms of colonialism:
  - One group or country subjugating another group, often imposing laws, religion, culture, and languages on that group, and taking resources from them
    - Zuckerberg and Meta are imposing their products on groups around the world
    - They are taking the resource of behavioral data and Meta’s shareholders will profit
    - The new users may join enthusiastically, but the bargain is between unequal groups
  - Justified by belief in the inferiority of the subjugated people (e.g., barbaric, savage, godless, backwards), and the superiority of the group doing the subjugation (e.g., civilized, advanced)
    - Zuckerberg focuses on ways he notices that it is worse in rural India:
      - [Zuckerberg said] [“There were, like, 40 students sitting on the floor, and then the guy running it was saying that there were 1.4 million schools and this was one of the better ones,” he said later—he can never resist a statistic. “There was no power. There are no toilets in the whole village!”](https://time.com/facebook-world-plan/)
      - But that might not be the whole picture
        - If one of them came and visited Mark Zuckerberg, they might say, for example: “Oh, I see. You have no real friends. That’s sad.”
        - Zuckerberg also, ignores how his company (and larger industry and world powers) might have exploited people in rural India and kept them in poverty

## The Story of WhatsApp
- WhatsApp, while founded in 2009 in the US, became very popular outside the US, becoming much more commonly used than Facebook Messenger
- In 2014 Facebook spent $19 billion dollars to purchase WhatsApp
  - “WhatsApp was just too far ahead in the international mobile messaging race for Facebook to catch up[...] Facebook either had to surrender the linchpin to mobile social networking abroad, or pony up and acquire WhatsApp before it got any bigger. It chose the latter.” ([TechCruch](https://techcrunch.com/2014/02/19/facebook-whatsapp/))

## Other options?
- China’s separate social media ecosystem
- Academic research project:
  - [Social Media Platforms for Low-Income Blind People in India](https://www.adityavashistha.com/uploads/2/0/8/0/20800650/vism_assets_2015.pdf)

## Imagining Alternatives

Different ways online social media could work

Are these alternatives good ideas? ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯


Try to work out how these alternatives might work

- What if social media sites were governed by their users instead of by shareholders?
  - How would users participate in decision making?
  - Would non-users have a say (e.g., if the whole user base decides to harass a group of non-users)?
  - How do you think the sites would work differently?
- What if social media sites were created in other countries and cultures?
  - What different values would be embedded and what would that look like?
  - For example, many cultures value family connections much more than white Americans do, but current American social media sites do not emphasize them.

## Programming as Colonialism
- [Coding places](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/coding-places) / international programming
  - English programming languages as standard  (vs. Non-English programming languages not able to get traction)
  - Silicon Valley as the geographic and financial center of the programming world
    - "If you want your art to be in a museum in Chicago, move to New York City", similarly programming language/library and Silicon Valley
    - how software tools move from Center to rest of world https://stackoverflow.blog/2017/08/29/tale-two-industries-programming-languages-differ-wealthy-developing-countries/
