# What is Capitalism?

## Definition:
- “an economic system characterized by private or corporate ownership of capital goods, by investments that are determined by private decision, and by prices, production, and the distribution of goods that are determined mainly by competition in a free market” [Merriam-Webster Dictionary](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/capitalism)
- To simplify:
  - Individuals or corporations own businesses
  - These owners make what they want and set their own prices, competing with other businesses
  - These owners hire [wage-laborers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wage_labour) at predetermined rates for their work, while the owners get the excess business profits or losses

## Capitalism vs. Socialism
- [Socialism](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/socialism): the government owns businesses (ie services), and determines what will be made and what the price is
For example, there is one seattle city sewer system run by the government. Having many competing sewer systems could actually make a big mess of the underground pipe system.
  - Price to customers could be free, like public schools, or highways
  - Government hires wage-laborers at predetermined rates for their work. Excess “profits” or “losses” are taken on by government (and taxes help pay for services that run at a loss)
- Capitalism vs. Socialism
  - Business decisions are accountable to:
    - Capitalism: share holders
      - The more shares a person owns, the more that person can shape business decisions.
    - Socialism: government leaders
      - In a representative democracy like in the US, those government leaders are accountable to voters. Theoretically, every eligible voter has an equal say in business/service decisions.
