# Imagining Alternatives

Different ways online social media could work

Are these alternatives good ideas? ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯


Try to work out how these alternatives might work

- What if government regulations said that social media sites weren’t allowed make money based on personal data / targeted advertising.
  - What other business models could they use?
- What if government regulations were made to encourage a free market by requiring that users could switch social media sites easily (interoperability). How would this work?
  - Would you be able to move all your data? Would you still be able to see the content your friends post on the site you used to be on?
- What if there were a social media site funded by the government instead of by a private company (like NPR for radio, and PBS for TV)?
  - What could this social media site do differently? What do you think would work well, what would work poorly?
  - Private companies are allowed to restrict speech in ways government entities are not. How would this impact content moderation if government funds were used?
