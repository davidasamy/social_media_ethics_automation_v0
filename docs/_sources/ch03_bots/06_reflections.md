# Reflection questions
- How are people’s expectations different for a bot and a “normal” user?
- How do you think about identity and responsibility with a bot’s actions?
- How do platforms enable bots to function?
- Why do platforms allow bots to operate?
   - (from a perspective of what their users want, and from a perspective of making profit)

- choose an example bot from the bot examples section, or find your own other bot, and consider:
  - What does this bot do that a normal person wouldn't be able to, or wouldn't be able to as easily?
  - Who is in charge of running this bot?
  - Does the fact that it is a bot change how you feel about it's actions?
