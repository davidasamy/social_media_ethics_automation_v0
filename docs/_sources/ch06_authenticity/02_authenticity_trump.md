Concept: Accessing specific data from tweets

- Getting info about tweets
  - Trump Tweets different between iPhone and Android
    - “My analysis ... concludes that the Android and iPhone tweets are clearly from different people, “posting during different times of day and using hashtags, links, and retweets in distinct ways,
    - “What’s more, we can see that the Android tweets are angrier and more negative, while the iPhone tweets tend to be benign announcements and pictures. .... this lets us tell the difference between the campaign’s tweets (iPhone) and Trump’s own (Android).”
