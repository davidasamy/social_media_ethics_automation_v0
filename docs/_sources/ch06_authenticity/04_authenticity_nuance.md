TODO: reorganize

- You already watched: Lindsay Ellis: [YouTube: Manufacturing Authenticity (For Fun and Profit!)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8FJEtCvb2Kw), which covered things like:
  - “Calls to action”
  - business models
  - Emotional Labor / maintaining an affect
  - the “Youtube algorithm”
- Persona / Brand
  - We all act in different ways in different groups / situations
- [Corporate brand authenticity](https://www.vice.com/en/article/pangw8/brand-twitter-is-absurd-and-it-will-only-get-worse)?

- Parasocial Relationships
  - (StrucciMovies: [Fake Friends Series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3vD_CAYt4g&list=PL7-HzFax9fcxbuDiKPZGdIV69N5-MszEa)) (Sarah Z: [How Fans Treat Creators](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0l_biTU3Vg) 33 min)
  - ![gif of Mr. Rogers saying to the camera: "I like you just the way you are"](mr_rogers.gif)
    - Intentionally fostered parasocial relationship with children.
    - Succeeded in that Kyle even sent a letter to him, and got a letter back (from Fred Rogers or maybe a secretary? who knows)
    - Did Fred Rogers know that Kyle existed? Possibly for a few minutes, probably not after that. Was childhood Kyle's feeling that Mr. Rogers would like him if they met correct? Possibly, or even probably?


## Authenticity and Anonymity
- Does anonymity encourage / discourage authenticity?
  - Anonymity can encourage inauthentic behavior
    - You can pretend to be someone you are not
    - Your actions can’t be traced back to you (maybe)
  - Anonymity can encourage authentic behavior
    - You can express things about yourself you are not allowed to express in normal life
    - You can avoid negative reactions to your authentic self-expression
- Is authenticity good?
  - What authentic thing about yourself are you expressing?
    - Cruelty? Hate?
