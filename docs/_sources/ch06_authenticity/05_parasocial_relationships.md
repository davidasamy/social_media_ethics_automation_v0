   - Intentionally fostered parasocial relationship with children.
   - Succeeded in that Kyle even sent a letter to him, and got a letter back (from Fred Rogers or maybe a secretary? who knows)
   - Did Fred Rogers know that Kyle existed? Possibly for a few minutes, probably not after that. Was childhood Kyle's feeling that Mr. Rogers would like him if they met correct? Possibly, or even probably?
