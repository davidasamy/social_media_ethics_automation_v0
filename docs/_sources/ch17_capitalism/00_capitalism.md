# Capitalism

## Definition:
- “an economic system characterized by private or corporate ownership of capital goods, by investments that are determined by private decision, and by prices, production, and the distribution of goods that are determined mainly by competition in a free market” [Merriam-Webster Dictionary](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/capitalism)
- To simplify:
  - Individuals or corporations own businesses
  - These owners make what they want and set their own prices, competing with other businesses
  - These owners hire [wage-laborers](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/capitalism) at predetermined rates for their work, while the owners get the excess business profits or losses

## Capitalism vs. Socialism
- [Socialism](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/socialism): the government owns businesses (ie services), and determines what will be made and what the price is
For example, there is one seattle city sewer system run by the government. Having many competing sewer systems could actually make a big mess of the underground pipe system.
  - Price to customers could be free, like public schools, or highways
  - Government hires wage-laborers at predetermined rates for their work. Excess “profits” or “losses” are taken on by government (and taxes help pay for services that run at a loss)
- Capitalism vs. Socialism
  - Business decisions are accountable to:
    - Capitalism: share holders
      - The more shares a person owns, the more that person can shape business decisions.
    - Socialism: government leaders
      - In a representative democracy like in the US, those government leaders are accountable to voters. Theoretically, every eligible voter has an equal say in business/service decisions.

## Meta’s Business Model (how shareholders get profits)
- See [Surveillance Capitalism](https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2019/02/shoshana-zuboff-q-and-a-the-age-of-surveillance-capital.html)
- Internet companies use user behavior data to personally tailor their sites for users
- These companies then found they could collect even more data, make predictions based on it, and turn it into products to sell
- Meta doesn’t normally sell the data or predictions directly
  - Meta sells access to their users based on Meta’s predictions about them (e.g., you can buy ads that target people who are likely to be pregnant)
- How Meta can maximize its profit:
  - more users
  - more user time
  - more personal data (behavioral surplus)
  - reduced competition (corner the marked on access to those users)

## Meta’s Business Plan to Corner the Market of Social Media
- Background terms
  - [Network effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_effect): Something is more useful the more people use it (e.g., telephones, the metric system)
  - [Network power](https://alliance-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/permalink/f/kjtuig/CP71119582520001451): When more people start using something, it becomes harder to use to alternatives
- Goal: Most users possible to use Meta (and only Meta) for social media
  - With aims to corner the market on social media: every human uses Meta for social media
- Problem: Users [don’t want ads on The Facebook](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k5fJmkv02is)
  - Attract users by having no ads until Facebook has enough network power to introduce ads without losing users or momentum (which is what they did in 2007)
- Problem: People speak different languages
  - Solution: Increase language support
- Problem: Not everyone has the internet
  - Solution: [Give them internet](https://time.com/facebook-world-plan/), but push them to Facebook while doing so: [Free Basic](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/jul/27/facebook-free-basics-developing-markets)
- Problem: Competing company has a user base (e.g., [Instagram, Snapchat](https://www.businessinsider.com/mark-zuckerberg-grilled-on-facebook-copying-instagram-snapchat-2020-7))
  - Solution: If possible, buy company, or copy their features

## Responses to Meta’s Business Strategies

  - Google+
    - Never got enough users to take off
  - Unique features (e.g., Twitter character limit, Vine and TikTok short videos, etc.)
  - China - alternate market, different governmental concerns and resources
  - [Mastodon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastodon_(software)) - open source - not for profit

  - EUs [General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Data_Protection_Regulation) law
  - Apple introduced [app tracking transparency in 2021](http://theverge.com/2021/12/11/22828713/apple-app-tracking-transparancy-psa-privacy-ads-cohorts)

## Meta’s Governance vs. Users
- Reminder: Meta’s decisions are driven by shareholders (especially those with the most $ in shares), and those shareholders get the profits Meta makes (especially those with the most $ in shares)
- Users of Meta’s platform have little say in decisions made by the company. The main actions they can are:
  - Use the site less or delete their account
    - Can be done in coordination with others (see Spotify recently)
    - When sites make interface changes, they don’t give those changes to everyone at once, making it harder to organize a coordinated exodus
  - Vote for representatives that will regulate social media sites
    - Though Meta spends money to lobby those representatives


## Imagining Alternatives

Different ways online social media could work

Are these alternatives good ideas? ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯

Try to work out how these alternatives might work

- What if government regulations said that social media sites weren’t allowed make money based on personal data / targeted advertising.
  - What other business models could they use?
- What if government regulations were made to encourage a free market by requiring that users could switch social media sites easily. How would this work?
  - Would you be able to move all your data? Would you still be able to see the content your friends post on the site you used to be on?
- What if there were a social media site funded by the government or public fundraising instead of by a private company (like NPR for radio, and PBS for TV)?
  - What could this social media site do differently? What do you think would work well, what would work poorly?
  - Private companies are allowed to restrict speech in ways government entities are not. How would this impact content moderation?

## Programming, Gender, and Money
- How software went from disrespected / low pay / women’s work to respected / men’s work
  - First programmers were women, seen as a lower status role to the men in charge of the hardware (Ada Lovelace to Charles Babbage, "ENIAC Girls", Dorothy Vaughan (of Hidden Figures))
  - These women made many of the early advances in programming
    - Also, Grace Hopper and the compiler / programming in english
    - Margaret Hamilton and the term “software engineering” (to try to get it respected like other engineering)
  - Up to the 60s/70s computer hardware was what was sold for a lot of money, and software came free or owners of the hardware were expected to hire (women) to make that for their Computers.
  - Then in the 1980s some men figured out there was a lot of money to be made in software
    - Particularly Bill Gates, who wrote software some computer companies needed, and licensed his companies' software
  - Computers, software, and computer games became seen as "mens'" fields
    - CS degrees were like 40% women, dropped precipiticly
    - gaming excluding women: https://www.polygon.com/features/2013/12/2/5143856/no-girls-allowed
