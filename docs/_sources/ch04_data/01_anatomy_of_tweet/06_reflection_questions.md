# Reflection Questions
Let's look at an example of information we might want to store on a computer:

If we look at a data field like gender, there are different ways we might try to represent it. We might try to represent it as a binary field, but that would exclude people who don't fit within a gender binary. So we might try a string that allows any values, but taking whatever users type might make data that is difficult to work with. So we might try using strings, but have a preset list of options for users to choose from, perhaps with a way of choosing "other" and allow users to type their own explanation if our categories didn't work for them. Perhaps you question whether you want to store gender information at all.

Now it's your turn, choose some data that you might want to store on a social media type, and think through the storage types and constraints you might want to use:
  - Age
  - Name
  - Address
  - Relationship status
  - etc.
