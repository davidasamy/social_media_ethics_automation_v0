# Data and Data Mining

reading ???

## How data is saved in a computer
- Different types of storage
  - Integer (whole number)
  - Float (number with decimal points)
  - Boolean (true/false) and binary (0/1)
  - String (text)
    - Pre-set options
    - Open ended
  - List of something
  - Etc.
- What type of storage type makes sense for different types of data?
  - Age
  - Gender
  - Name
  - Address
  - Relationship status

## All data is a simplification of reality
- Tomatoes example
- Census example

## Whose data fits?
- What data and options a social media site includes determine who fits naturally in the system, and who has to modify themselves to fit in the system
- Examples:
  - Gender
  - Name (length limits, which letter systems allowed, etc.)
- Systems have power to “bestow humanity on marginalized others” (Professor Anna Lauren Hoffmann)

## What all data is available to social media platforms?
- Data user directly provides
  - E.g., filling out your profile info
- Other data platform collects
  - What you click on, what you pause on, when you log in, etc.



## Programming
exercises for programming should be:

1) looking at twitter interface, what information does it have? What limitations and data types? etc.

2) now let's look at what data is available from the twitter API and how it is organized
