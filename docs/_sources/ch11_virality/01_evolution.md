# Evolution
First, an overview of evolution
- Evolution occurs when these three conditions are present
  - Replication (with Inheritance)
    - An organism can make a new copy of itself, which inherits its characteristics
  - Variations / Mutations
    - The characteristics of an organism are sometimes changed, in a way that can be inherited by future copies
  - Natural Selection
    - Some characteristics make it more or less likely for an organism to compete for resources, survive, and make copies of itself
- When those three conditions are present, the over time organisms
  - Adapt to their environment
  - Diversify
  - Develop strategies for competing with or cooperating with other organisms.
