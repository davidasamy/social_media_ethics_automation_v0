# Natural selection in social media
- Replication (with inheritance) examples
  - In system: Like, retweet, quote tweet, reply, subtweet
  - Remove from system: screenshot, download, cross-post (to different site), copy without attribution
  - Modify (see below) and post
- Variations / Mutations
  - Modify text, Screenshot, change text, Photoshop, subtweet, add to and repost, etc.
- Selection
  - Human decisions to engage/replicate
    - Based on reactions like “that’s funny!” or “that’s horrible” or “I have a great comeback to that!” or “re-posting this will make me look smart!”, etc.
  - Algorithm decisions to put in people’s feeds, or list as trending
  - Organizations decide to highlight social media phenomenon (e.g., news organizations)
