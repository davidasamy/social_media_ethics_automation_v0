- “Bean Dad”
 - John Roderick posted twitter thread on Jan. 2, 2021
9-year-old daughter was hungry and had asked him to open a can of beans
  - He told her to figure out how to use the can-opener herself and refused to help her
    - ![Tweet by @johnroderick: I said, "The tool is made to be pleasing but it doesn't have any superfluous qualities. Everything that moves does so for a reason." She said, "I hate you." I'm sure she believes that she does. I said "You understand everything except how the tool addresses the can." She sighed.](bean_dad.png)
  - Six hours later she finally figured out how to open the can
  - “While Roderick tweeted the story as though it were a proud parenting moment, many criticized the story for teaching poor lessons to the daughter with some going so far as to call it abuse and others made jokes about the story.”
  - In response to this story one twitter user posted this: ![Tweet by @maplecocaine: Each day on twitter there is one main character. The goal is to never be it](main_character.png) and now "the main character of the day on twitter" is a common phrase.
- Intentionally “bad” or “offensive”
