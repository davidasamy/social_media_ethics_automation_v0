# Design Activity
- Come up with a theoretical set of rules for what would make a “good” tweet to recommend
  - Look at the available data that the twitter API has to see what you want to use
  - Note: you will get a chance to try this out for a homework assignment

## Programming: printing thread tweets and replies (needs recursion)
