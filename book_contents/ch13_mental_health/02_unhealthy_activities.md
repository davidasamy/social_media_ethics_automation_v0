## Digital Self-Harm Example: Incels
- [Incels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incel): A toxic community of lonely, single men
  - “Incel” is short for “involuntarily celibate” meaning they are men who have centered their identity on wanting to have sex with women, but with no women “giving” them sex
  - “The Red Pill”:
    - only “Alpha” men (aka “Chads”) get sex from women, so learn how to be an Alpha
  - “The Black Pill”:
    - Your biology (e.g., skull shape) means no women will “give” you sex. You will be forever alone, without sex, and unhappy.
  - Incels view sex with women as a right, which is being “unfairly” withheld from them by women, Chads, and “feminism” (they are objectifying women and sex)
  - Often hatred and violence directed at themselves, as well as at others (women and “Chads”)
    - Incel community has produced multiple mass murderers / terrorists attacks
