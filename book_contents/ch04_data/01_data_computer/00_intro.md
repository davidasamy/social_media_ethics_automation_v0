# Representing Data in a Computer

[TODO: What is data?]


We previously covered in chapter 2 how [computers speak binary](../../ch02_definitions/03_automation/03_binary.html), and all data and instructions are turned into binary, and gave examples of how images or text can be represented with binary. There are many ways of representing data on a computer (called "data types"), so we'll look at a few types of them here.

As we've said previously, don't worry if you don't understand all of these data types yet. We'll be covering various ones in more detail throughout the book.
