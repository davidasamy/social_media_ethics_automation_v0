# Who does data fit?
Because (almost) all data is a simplification of reality, those simplifications work well for some people and some situations, but can cause problems for other people and other situations.

- What data and options a social media site includes determine who fits naturally in the system, and who has to modify themselves to fit in the system
- Examples:
  - Gender
  - Name (length limits, which letter systems allowed, etc.)
