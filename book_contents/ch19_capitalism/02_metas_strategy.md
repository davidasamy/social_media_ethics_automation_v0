# Meta's Strategy

## Meta’s Business Model (how shareholders get profits)
- See [Surveillance Capitalism](https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2019/02/shoshana-zuboff-q-and-a-the-age-of-surveillance-capital.html)
- Internet companies use user behavior data to personally tailor their sites for users
- These companies then found they could collect even more data, make predictions based on it, and turn it into products to sell
- Meta doesn’t normally sell the data or predictions directly
  - Meta sells access to their users based on Meta’s predictions about them (e.g., you can buy ads that target people who are likely to be pregnant)
- How Meta can maximize its profit:
  - more users
  - more user time
  - more personal data (behavioral surplus)
  - reduced competition (corner the marked on access to those users)

## Meta’s Business Plan to Corner the Market of Social Media
- Background terms
  - [Network effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_effect): Something is more useful the more people use it (e.g., telephones, the metric system)
  - [Network power](https://alliance-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/permalink/f/kjtuig/CP71119582520001451): When more people start using something, it becomes harder to use to alternatives
- Goal: Most users possible to use Meta (and only Meta) for social media
  - With aims to corner the market on social media: every human uses Meta for social media
- Problem: Users [don’t want ads on The Facebook](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k5fJmkv02is)
  - Attract users by having no ads until Facebook has enough network power to introduce ads without losing users or momentum (which is what they did in 2007)
- Problem: People speak different languages
  - Solution: Increase language support
- Problem: Not everyone has the internet
  - Solution: [Give them internet](https://time.com/facebook-world-plan/), but push them to Facebook while doing so: [Free Basic](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/jul/27/facebook-free-basics-developing-markets)
- Problem: Competing company has a user base (e.g., [Instagram, Snapchat](https://www.businessinsider.com/mark-zuckerberg-grilled-on-facebook-copying-instagram-snapchat-2020-7))
  - Solution: If possible, buy company, or copy their features
