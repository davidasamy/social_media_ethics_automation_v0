# Meta vs. Users
- Reminder: Meta’s decisions are driven by shareholders (especially those with the most \$ in shares), and those shareholders get the profits Meta makes (especially those with the most \$ in shares)
- Users of Meta’s platform have little say in decisions made by the company. The main actions they can are:
  - Use the site less or delete their account
    - Can be done in coordination with others (see Spotify recently)
    - When sites make interface changes, they don’t give those changes to everyone at once, making it harder to organize a coordinated exodus
  - Vote for representatives that will regulate social media sites
    - Though Meta spends money to lobby those representatives
