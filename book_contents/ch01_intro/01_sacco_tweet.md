1. Someone emailed the tweet to valleywag.gawker.com. Valleywag wrote post on it and tweeted the post.
1. Word spread and Justine's tweet went viral. Twitter users found other recent offensive tweets by Justine about countries she was traveling in.
1. IAC (Justine's employer) called tweet “outrageous, offensive” but “Unfortunately, the employee in question is unreachable on an international flight.”
1. Twitter users, now knowing that Justine is on a flight, started the hashtag #hasjustinelanedyet, which started trending on twitter (including some celebrities tweeting about it).

## What our focus will be
Rather than talk about whether any or all of the responses to Justine’s racist joke tweet were deserved, let’s instead talk about why it played out as it did:
- Why did so many people see it?
- How did it spread?
- What enabled someone to be able to get a photo of her checking the phone at the airport?


## Reflection questions
- What motivated twitter users put time and energy into this?
- What things about the design of twitter enabled these events to happen?
  - ![Screenshot of Sacco's tweet, with the text grayed out. Twitter interface has: user name and image, options for Reply, Retweet, Favorite and More; Counts of Retweets and Favorites; and time (10:19Am - 20 Dec 13) and location (Hillingdon, London)](sacco_tweet_interface.png)
  - For example, you might notice that the interface shows where Sacco was located when tweeting, Hillingdon, London, which is where Heathrow Airport is located, helping people deduce which flight she was on.
- What financial motivations does twitter have? How does that influence twitters design?
- What changes to twitter could have changed how this story went?
