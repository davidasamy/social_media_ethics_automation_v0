# Some Simple Data Types

First we'll look at a few simple data storage types, called [primitive data types](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primitive_data_type).

Note: We'll demonstrate these later in this chapter.

## Booleans (True / False)
Binary consisting of 0s and 1s make it easy to represent true and false values, where 1 often represents true and 0 represents false. Most programming languages have built in ways of representing True and False values.

## Numbers
Numbers are normally stored in two different ways:
- Integer: whole numbers like 5, 37, -10, and 0
- Floating point numbers: these can represent decimals like: 0.75, -1.333, and 3 x 10 ^ 8

In both of those storage methods, there are limits to how much space is used to save each number, limiting how big (or small) the numbers can be, and causing rounding with floating point numbers.

Additionally programming languages might include ways of representing fractions, or [complex numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_number).

## Characters (Letters and other symbols)
Computers can store "characters" can be letters, numerals, or other symbols (like math symbols, spaces, and "[newlines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newline)" which go to the next line when you press "Enter"). Some ways of storing characters, like [unicode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode), support storing symbols and letters from many languages, and also [emojis](https://unicode.org/emoji/charts/full-emoji-list.html).
