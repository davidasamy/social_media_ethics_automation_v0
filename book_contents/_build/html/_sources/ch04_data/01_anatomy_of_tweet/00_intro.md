# Anatomy of a Tweet

[TODO: What is data?]

TODO: New outline of first section:

Anatomy of a tweet
- show a screenshot of a tweet, pointing out all the pieces of data (also pieces of data that aren't visible)
- go through the different types of data (numbers, strings, dates, locations, users, etc. )
  - first common data types, then combined data types (list of people who liked it, dictionary to hold it all together etc.)



We previously covered in chapter 2 how [computers speak binary](../../ch02_definitions/03_automation/03_binary.md), and all data and instructions are turned into binary, and gave examples of how images or text can be represented with binary. There are many ways of representing data on a computer (called "data types"), so we'll look at a few types of them here.

As we've said previously, don't worry if you don't understand all of these data types yet. We'll be covering various ones in more detail throughout the book.
