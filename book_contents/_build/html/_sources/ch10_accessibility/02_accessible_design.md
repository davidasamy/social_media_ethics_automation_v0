# Accessible Design

Finding places you fit:

- The two authors, who both have ADHD, were drawn to PhD programs where their hyperfocus and following their curiosity was rewarded (though executive function problems in finishing projects was a challenge)

## Adaptive technology (what was the term again?)

make a person fit the environment
For the disabilities of the authors:
- glasses for vision
- stimulant medication (which can be hard to get) can make someone with ADHD be more like neurotypical people

other examples?


## Universal Design
making something with ways for different abilities to access it

## Ability Based Design
