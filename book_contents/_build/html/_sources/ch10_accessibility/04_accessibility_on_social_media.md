# Activity: Accessibility on Social Media

Go to a social media site and find the accessibility and other related settings. For example, [Twitters settings are here](https://twitter.com/settings/accessibility_display_and_languages).

For each setting you see, try to come up with what disabilities that setting would be beneficial for (there may be multiple).
