# As a Social Media User

 - as social media user - know what happens to your data, understand the ecosystem you are using, etc.

As a social media user, we hope you learn how social media sites influence you, from how your data gets used or abused, to how harassment and spam bots operate, to how platforms manipulate your emotions and mental state. We hope you could then be a more knowledgeable consumer and participant on social media sites.
