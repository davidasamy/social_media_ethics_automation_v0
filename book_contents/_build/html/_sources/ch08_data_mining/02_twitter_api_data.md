## Dictionaries
- A data structure with a set of “keys” that refer to a set of “values.” Sort of like saving a bunch of variables in another variable.
- Create an empty dictionary:
```
example_dictionary = {}
Create a dictionary with some keys and values:
example_dictionary = {
  "first_name": "Kyle",
  "last_name": "Thayer"
}
```
- Get a value from a dictionary:
```    
person = example_dictionary["first_name"]
```
- Set a value from a dictionary:
```
    Example_dictionary["age"] = 38
```
