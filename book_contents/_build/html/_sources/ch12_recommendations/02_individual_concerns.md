# Individual Concerns with Recommendation Algorithms

Let's look at some individual concerns with how recommendation algorithms work.

## How recommendations can go well or poorly

### Friends or Follows:

Recommendations for friends or people to follow can go well when the algorithm finds you people you want to connect with.

Recommendations can go poorly when they do something like recommend an ex or an abuser because they share many connections with you.

### Reminders:

Automated reminders can go well in a situation such as when a user enjoys the nostalgia of seeing something from their past.

Automated reminders can go poorly when they give users unwanted or painful reminders, such as for [miscarriages](https://www.theatlantic.com/family/archive/2018/11/digital-reminders-miscarriages/575050/), funerals, or [break-ups](https://www.wired.com/story/weddings-social-media-apps-photos-memories-miscarriage-problem/)


### Ads:
Advertisements shown to users can go well for users when the users find products they are genuinely interested in, and for making the social media site free to use (since the site makes its money from ads).

Advertisements can go poorly if they become part of discrimination ([like only showing housing ads to certain demographics of people](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/06/21/doj-settles-with-facebook-over-allegedly-discriminatory-housing-ads.html)), or reveal private information (like [revealing to a family that someone is pregnant](https://www.forbes.com/sites/kashmirhill/2012/02/16/how-target-figured-out-a-teen-girl-was-pregnant-before-her-father-did/))

### Content (posts, photos, articles, etc.)
Content recommendations can go well when users find content they are interested in.

Content recommendations can go poorly when it sends people down problematic chains of content, like by [grouping videos of children in a convenient way for pedophiles](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/20/technology/youtube-pedophiles.html), or Amazon [recommending groups of materials for suicide](https://www.npr.org/2022/10/09/1127686507/amazon-suicide-teenagers-poison).

## Gaming the recommendation algorithm
- Clickbait
- Adding photos and media
- Trolling
- Coordinated actions (posting, likes, tagging, hashtags, etc.)
- May be done with bots
- How usersâ€™ race affects strategies for the algorithm:

## Reflections

- What responsibilities do you think social media platforms should have in regards to the concerns we just discussed?
- What strategies do you think might work to improve how social media platforms use recommendations?
