# Reflections questions

- When one of us ran the program, who made those tweets (me? you? the bot?)?
- Notice that there are two times of actions for posting tweets with this bot, one is when the code is written, and the other is when the code is run. These could even be done by different people.
  - How do you divide out responsibility for a bots actions between the person writing the code and the person running the program?
