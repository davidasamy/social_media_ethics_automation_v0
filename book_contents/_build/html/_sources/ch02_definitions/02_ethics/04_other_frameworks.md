Other Frameworks to Consider When Thinking about Ethics

## [Colonialism](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/colonialism/)
- One group or country subjugating another group, often imposing laws, religion, culture, and languages on that group, and taking resources from them.
- Justified by belief in the inferiority of the subjugated people (e.g., barbaric, savage, godless, backwards), and the superiority of the group doing the subjugation (e.g., civilized, advanced).
- Subtler forms of this reasoning are [common in tech](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/jul/27/facebook-free-basics-developing-markets): We Americans are benefiting the world by [flooding the world with our superior products](https://www.theverge.com/2018/4/16/17233946/olpcs-100-laptop-education-where-is-it-now) (often made cheaply in other parts of the world)

- The colonized/oppressed taking back power from the colonialists/oppressors, whether from:
  - Government occupation (e.g., England ruling India/Pakistan, USA removing Indigenous Americans from their land, USA ruling Cuba and the Philippines)

## [Individual vs. Systemic Analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemic_bias)
- Individual analysis focuses on the behavior or bias an individual has, while systemic analysis focuses on the how organizations and rules may have their own behaviors or biases that aren’t necessarily connected to what any individual inside intends.
  - For example, there were differences in US criminal sentencing guidelines between crack cocaine vs. powder cocaine in the 90s. When these guidelines were followed, they had have racially biased (that is, racist) outcomes regardless of intent or bias of the individual judges. (See: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_Sentencing_Act)


## [Intersectionality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intersectionality)
- People are treated differently based on their identities (e.g., race, gender, class, disability, weight, height, etc.), but combinations of those identities can compound unfair treatment in complicated ways.
- For example, you can test a resume filter and find that it isn’t biased against black people, and it isn’t biased against women. But it might turn out that it is still biased against black women.
  - This could happen because the filter “fixed” the gender and race bias by over-selecting white women and black men, while under-selecting black women.

  - [![Photo of bell hooks](hooks.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell_hooks) [bell hooks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell_hooks), present USA

## [Design Justice](https://design-justice.pubpub.org/)
- “Design justice is a framework for analysis of how design distributes benefits and burdens between various groups of people. Design justice focuses explicitly on the ways that design reproduces and/or challenges the matrix of domination (white supremacy, heteropatriarchy, capitalism, ableism, settler colonialism, and other forms of structural inequality).”
- It’s also about which groups get to be part of the design process itself.
