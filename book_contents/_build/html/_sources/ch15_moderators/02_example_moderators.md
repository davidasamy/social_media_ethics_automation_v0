# Example Moderator Set-ups

## Reddit
- Upvote/downvote system
- Moderators with special privileges
- Reddit forbids moderators from making money
- Reddit thread:
  - “Reddit is valued at more than ten billion dollars, yet it is extremely dependent on mods who work for absolutely nothing. Should they be paid, and does this lead to power-tripping mods?”
  - https://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/comments/qrjwjw/reddit_is_valued_at_more_than_ten_billion_dollars/
- Discussion Question:
  - What is your take on the ethical trade-offs of unpaid reddit moderators? What do you think Reddit should do?

## Wikipedia
- Editors and administrators are generally not, paid, though they can be paid by other groups if they [disclose and fill out forms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Paid-contribution_disclosure)
- Editors of wikipedia [skew heavily male](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Wikipedians) (around 80% or 90%)
  - Administrators presumably do as well
- This can produce bias in how things are moderated
  - [Donna Strickland had no Wikipedia page before her Nobel. Her male collaborator did.](https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/2018/10/2/17929366/nobel-prize-physics-donna-strickland)
  - “Articles on Strickland had been drafted on the online encyclopedia before in May 2018 — but the draft was rejected by moderators. ‘This submission’s references do not show that the subject qualifies for a Wikipedia article,’ the moderators wrote, despite the fact that the original author linked to a page that showed Strickland was once president of the Optical Society, a major physics professional organization and publisher of some of the field’s top journals.”
- Discussion Question:
  - How should wikipedia handle their editor/administrator demographics?

## Facebook
- Facebook uses paid moderation teams
- Facebook sought out users from all over the globe, [but as of 2019](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-facebook-languages-insight/facebooks-flood-of-languages-leaves-it-struggling-to-monitor-content-idUSKCN1RZ0DW)…
  - Menus and prompts in 111 different languages, deemed to be “officially supported”
  - “Community standards” rules only translated into 41 languages
  - Content moderators know about 50 languages (they say they hire  professional translators when needed)
  - Automated tools for identifying hate speech work in about 30
- Discussion Questions:
  - What dangers are posed with languages that have limited or no content moderation?
  - What do you think Facebook should do about this?
