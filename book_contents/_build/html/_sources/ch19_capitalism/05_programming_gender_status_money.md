# Programming, Gender, Status, and Money
- How software went from disrespected / low pay / women’s work to respected / men’s work
  - First programmers were women, seen as a lower status role to the men in charge of the hardware (Ada Lovelace to Charles Babbage, "ENIAC Girls", Dorothy Vaughan (of Hidden Figures)). Also note that Ada Lovelace had status/money/leisure with which to study math and what would become computers, and that the early women "computers" and programmers were cheaper to pay than men.
  - These women made many of the early advances in programming
    - Also, Grace Hopper and the compiler / programming in english
    - Margaret Hamilton and the term “software engineering” (to try to get it respected like other engineering)
  - Up to the 60s/70s computer hardware was what was sold for a lot of money, and software came free or owners of the hardware were expected to hire (women) to make that for their Computers.
  - Then in the 1980s some men figured out there was a lot of money to be made in software
    - Particularly Bill Gates, who wrote software some computer companies needed, and licensed his companies' software
  - Computers, software, and computer games became seen as "mens'" fields
    - CS degrees were like 40% women, dropped precipiticly
