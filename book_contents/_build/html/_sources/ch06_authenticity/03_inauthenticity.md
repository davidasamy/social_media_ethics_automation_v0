## Inauthenticity

Can you think of some examples of inauthentic behaviors that are familiar from social media spaces?

In contrast to authentiticty is inauthenticity, which might look like:
  - Catfishing
  - Schrodingerâ€™s asshole
  - Sockpuppet (related to a burner account)
  - Astroturfing
  - Intentionally cringy TikToks
  - Clickbait
  - Concern trolling
  - Parody accounts

In this chapter we will explore how data and automation play a role in structuring the way we perceive and play out connections in social media spaces. Throughout the following sections, think about which examples seem authentic or inauthentic to you, and why. We will not talk about the above, more well-defined inauthentic behaviors until the next chapter, which is about trolling.
