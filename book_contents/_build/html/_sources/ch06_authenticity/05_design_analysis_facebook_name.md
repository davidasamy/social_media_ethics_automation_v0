Names allowed on Facebook.

Facebook is a community where everyone uses the name they go by in everyday life. This makes it so that you always know who you're connecting with.

What isn't allowed?
• Symbols, numbers, unusual capitalization, repeating characters or punctuation.
• Characters from multiple languages.
• Titles of any kind (example: professional, religious).
• Words or phrases in place of a name.
• Offensive or suggestive words of any kind.
If your name follows our standards and you're still having trouble changing it, find out why.

Things to keep in mind
• The name on your profile should be the name that your friends call you in everyday life. This name should also appear on an ID or • document from our ID list.
• Nicknames can be used as a first or middle name if they're a variation of your authentic name (like Bob instead of Robert).
• You can also list another name on your account (example: maiden name, nickname, professional name).
• Profiles are for individual use only. You can create a Page for a business, organization or idea.
• Pretending to be anything or anyone isn't allowed."
