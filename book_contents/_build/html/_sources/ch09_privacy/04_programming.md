# Programming: deanonymize (using csv loaded with pandas)
Some sort of deduce info (deanonymization)

write function (possibly earlier)??


Perhaps: Publicly tweet all my DMs!
  - Make function: get my latest DM

Then code is like:
dm = getMyLatestDM()  
client.createTweet(text="User ??? dm'd me: " + dm.text)


## Functions

- Reusable sections of code (an algorithm!)
- Function with no parameters
```
def function_name():
  # do various actions, like this:
  print("This is a function!")
```

- Function with parameters
```
def function_name(arg_1, arg_2):
  # do various actions, like this:
  print("This is a function that got:" + arg_1 + arg_2)
```
