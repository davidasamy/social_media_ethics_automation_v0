# Evolution and Memes
## Evolution
First, an overview of evolution
- Evolution occurs when these three conditions are present
  - Replication (with Inheritance)
    - An organism can make a new copy of itself, which inherits its characteristics
  - Variations / Mutations
    - The characteristics of an organism are sometimes changed, in a way that can be inherited by future copies
  - Natural Selection
    - Some characteristics make it more or less likely for an organism to compete for resources, survive, and make copies of itself
- When those three conditions are present, the over time organisms
  - Adapt to their environment
  - Diversify
  - Develop strategies for competing with or cooperating with other organisms.

## Memes
- [The Selfish Gene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Selfish_Gene) by Richard Dawkins (1976)
 - Genes: a section or sections of DNA that perform a function and are inherited
 - Considered evolution in terms of natural selection of genes, instead of natural selection of organism
   - If a bees genes cause it to sting and die to protect its nest (that shares those genes), then those genes reproduce.
 - Also coined word “meme” to refer to a piece of culture that might reproduce in an evolutionary fashion. For example, a hummable tune
- Memes
  - Any piece of human culture can be considered as a meme that is spreading (or not) according to evolutionary forces, such as:
    - Technology (languages, weapons, medicine, writing, math, computers, etc.), religions, philosophies, political ideas (democracy, authoritarianism, etc.), music, art, organizations, etc.
