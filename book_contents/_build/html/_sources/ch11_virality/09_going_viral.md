## Aside on “Cancel Culture”
- It seems to me that the term “cancel culture” is used to mean a number of different things.
  - For offenses ranging from a minor statement that offends some group, to sexual assault of minors (e.g., R. Kelly, Woody Allen, Kevin Spacey)
  - Facing a range of consequences like:
    - Celebrity losing  an audience (which may be their livelihood)
    - Public criticism of a comment or action
    - Harassment of a person for a comment  or action
    - Loss of jobs
    - Rejection of an apology or of a non-apology (e.g., I’m sorry if you were offended)
- Rather than discuss “cancel culture” as a single thing, we will cover it in pieces:
