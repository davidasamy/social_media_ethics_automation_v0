# Shame vs. Guilt in childhood development
- Childhood development (article you read: [Trauma and Shame](https://www.oohctoolbox.org.au/trauma-and-shame))
  - Shame: “I am bad”
    - Hide/ostracized
  - Guilt: “This specific action I did was bad”
    - Wants to repair
  - A good parent will tell their child to stop a bad action,
    - the child may feel shame,
    - the parent will then comfort the child, letting them know it was the action that was the problem, but the child is not bad and the relationship is not in danger.
    - The child learns to feel guilt (and seek repair) instead of shame (and try to hide)
- Are there cultural differences with shame and guilt?
Are there other definitions and was of conceptualizing shame and guilt?
  - Is this guilt view individualistic and [more common in individualistic cultures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guilt%E2%80%93shame%E2%80%93fear_spectrum_of_cultures)?
  - E.g., how does this relate to the concept of “[face](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Face_(sociological_concept))” in other cultures?
