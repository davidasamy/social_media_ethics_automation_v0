Design a feature for twitter that allows users to retract a tweet as an alternative to deleting a tweet.

- How would a user do the retraction? What options would they have (e.g., can they choose to keep or delete the original tweet content)? What additional information would they be able to provide?
- How would that retracted tweet look when viewed?
- How would that retracted tweet look when it is part of a retweet or quote tweet?
- Would there be any notifications sent when a tweet is retracted?
- Outline 3 different examples of how and when a user might retract a tweet
  - E.g., misinformation, regret bad idea, regret mean tone, etc.
