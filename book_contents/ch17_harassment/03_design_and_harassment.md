> I've made a deliberate choice against a quoting feature because it inevitably adds toxicity to people's behaviours. You are tempted to quote when you should be replying, and so you speak at your audience instead of with the person you are talking to. It becomes performative. Even when doing it for "good" like ridiculing awful comments, you are giving awful comments more eyeballs that way. No quote toots. Thank's

- [It's Not Your Fault You're a Jerk on Twitter](https://www.wired.com/story/social-media-harassment-platforms/): The design of the internet lets you harass and harm people without ever once interacting with them directly. Even if you're trying to defend them.
