# Different Ways a Program Can Be Organized

In order to understand how a bot is built and can work, we will now look at the different ways computer programs can be organized. We will not be looking at actual computer programming code in this section, but instead looking at how the code might be organized. We will look at real code examples of these in the next section.

TODO: Define psuedo code.

## Statements: Steps that Run In Order
Python is in a group of programming languages called [imperative programming languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperative_programming). At their core, programs written in imperative programming languages consist of a list of "statements" to be run in order.

So a program in one of these languages would look like:
```text
statement 1
statement 2
statement 3
```
And when the program is run, statement 1 runs first, then statement 2, then, finally, statement 3.

You might recognize this as the same style of instructions as a cooking recipe, like making a scrambled egg:
```text
1. Put frying pan on stove and turn it on.
2. Crack egg, and pour into the frying pan (throwing away the shell).
3. Add salt and pepper.
3. Stir egg while it cooks, until fully cooked.
```

In fact, the format of a cooking recipe is basically an imperative programming language where the cook acts as a "human computer" following the cooking instructions.

Twitter bots are generally organized in this same way, so one bot might be organized like this:
```text
1. Log into Twitter
2. Post offense tweet 1
3. Private message user 2
4. Block user 3
```

## Variables: Save information for later
The next organizing feature of programming languages like Python are "variables." Variables are a way of saving information for later use.

In a cooking recipe, an equivalent would be to put some of the preparation you've been doing to the side, so you can use it later:
```text
TODO: recipe with an ingredient made or mixed in a separate bowl, to be added later
```

```text
TODO: social media example where something is saved and loaded again
```

## Loops: Repeating Actions
```text
TODO: recipe with a repeated instruction, like for each egg, break it and throw out the shell, or put frosting on each cupcake
```



## Code Blocks: Grouping statements
```text
TODO: recipe with a set of steps to repeat, like a complicated set of toppings for each cupcake
```

### Pausing/Scheduling
```text
TODO: recipe: pull the muffins out of the oven after 10 minutes.
```

## Conditionals: What you do depends
```text
TODO: recipe where at 10 minutes you pull out the muffins and put in a toothpick. **If** the toothpick is clean, they are done, otherwise, put them in for another 2 minutes and check again.
```


## Events: When you do something depends
```text
TODO: Kettle: put on heat and leave until the kettle whistles, then make tea
```

## Functions/Libraries: Run another program
```text
TODO: recipe: step 1: make a base dough (see recipe on page 42).
```
