# Evolution in social media

Let's now turn to social media and look at how evolution happens there.

As we said before, evolution occurs when there is: replication (with inheritance), variations or mutations, and natural selection, so let's look at each of those.


## Replication (With Inheritance)
- In system: Like, retweet, quote tweet, reply, subtweet
- Remove from system: screenshot, download, cross-post (to different site), copy without attribution
- Modify (see below) and post

## Variations / Mutations
  - Modify text, Screenshot, change text, Photoshop, subtweet, add to and repost, etc.

## Natural Selection
- Human decisions to engage/replicate
  - Based on reactions like “that’s funny!” or “that’s horrible” or “I have a great comeback to that!” or “re-posting this will make me look smart!”, etc.
- Algorithm decisions to put in people’s feeds, or list as trending
- Organizations decide to highlight social media phenomenon (e.g., news organizations)
