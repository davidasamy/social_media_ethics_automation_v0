# What is Colonialism?

We already defined colonialism in chapter 2, but we thought we'd define it here again.

## [Colonialism](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/colonialism/)
Colonialism is when one group or country subjugates another group, often imposing laws, religion, culture, and languages on that group, and taking resources from them. Colonialism is often justified by belief that the subjugated people are inferior (e.g., barbaric, savage, godless, backwards), and the superiority of the group doing the subjugation (e.g., civilized, advanced).

## [Decolonization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decolonization) / [Postcolonialism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postcolonialism) / [Liberation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberation_movement) / [Landback](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Land_Back)

Counter to colonialism, decolonization, postcolonialism, liberation, and landback are movements where the colonized/oppressed take back power from the colonialists/oppressors, and graple with the consequences of having been colonized. This may be a response to colonization by:
- Government occupation (e.g., England ruling India/Pakistan, USA removing Indigenous Americans from their land, USA ruling Cuba and the Philippines)
