# Colonialism and Meta’s Strategy
- Putting Meta’s Strategy in terms of colonialism:
  - One group or country subjugating another group, often imposing laws, religion, culture, and languages on that group, and taking resources from them
    - Zuckerberg and Meta are imposing their products on groups around the world
    - They are taking the resource of behavioral data and Meta’s shareholders will profit
    - The new users may join enthusiastically, but the bargain is between unequal groups
  - Justified by belief in the inferiority of the subjugated people (e.g., barbaric, savage, godless, backwards), and the superiority of the group doing the subjugation (e.g., civilized, advanced)
    - Zuckerberg focuses on ways he notices that it is worse in rural India:
      - [Zuckerberg said] [“There were, like, 40 students sitting on the floor, and then the guy running it was saying that there were 1.4 million schools and this was one of the better ones,” he said later—he can never resist a statistic. “There was no power. There are no toilets in the whole village!”](https://time.com/facebook-world-plan/)
      - But that might not be the whole picture
        - If one of them came and visited Mark Zuckerberg, they might say, for example: “Oh, I see. You have no real friends. That’s sad.”
        - Zuckerberg also, ignores how his company (and larger industry and world powers) might have exploited people in rural India and kept them in poverty

## The Story of WhatsApp
- WhatsApp, while founded in 2009 in the US, became very popular outside the US, becoming much more commonly used than Facebook Messenger
- In 2014 Facebook spent $19 billion dollars to purchase WhatsApp
  - “WhatsApp was just too far ahead in the international mobile messaging race for Facebook to catch up[...] Facebook either had to surrender the linchpin to mobile social networking abroad, or pony up and acquire WhatsApp before it got any bigger. It chose the latter.” ([TechCruch](https://techcrunch.com/2014/02/19/facebook-whatsapp/))
