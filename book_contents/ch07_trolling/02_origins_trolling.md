# Origins of trolling

## Precursors of trolling
- Practical jokes, pranks, hazing, satire (e.g., [A Modest Proposal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Modest_Proposal))
- Fun at causing others pain:
  - “Boys throw stones at frogs in fun, but the frogs do not die in fun, but in earnest.”
[Bion of Borysthenes](https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Bion_of_Borysthenes) (c. 325 – c. 250 BC)
- [Bad Faith](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bad_faith)
  - Pretending to hold views or feelings, while not actually holding them (may be intentional, or may be through self-deception)
  - “Never believe that anti-Semites are completely unaware of the absurdity of their replies. They know that their remarks are frivolous, open to challenge. But they are amusing themselves, for it is their adversary who is obliged to use words responsibly, since he believes in words. The anti-Semites have the right to play. They even like to play with discourse for, by giving ridiculous reasons, they discredit the seriousness of their interlocutors. They delight in acting in bad faith, since they seek not to persuade by sound argument but to intimidate and disconcert. If you press them too closely, they will abruptly fall silent, loftily indicating by some phrase that the time for argument is past.”
    - [Jean-Paul Sartre - Written in Paris just after it was liberated from Nazi control](https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Jean-Paul_Sartre#Anti-Semite_and_Jew_(1945))
