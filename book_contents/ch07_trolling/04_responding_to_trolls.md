## Responding to trolls?
- “Don’t feed the trolls”
- A counter opinion:
  - https://www.theverge.com/2018/7/12/17561768/dont-feed-the-trolls-online-harassment-abuse
  - [Don’t feed the trolls] became the mantra of how to ignore online abuse completely.
  - [Not feeding the trolls doesn’t work] Ask anyone who has dealt with persistent harassment online, especially women: this is not usually what happens. Instead, the harasser keeps pushing and pushing to get the reaction they want with even more tenacity and intensity. It’s the same pattern on display in the litany of abusers and stalkers, both online and off, who escalate to more dangerous and threatening behavior when they feel like they are being ignored.
  - “Don’t feed the trolls” also ignores an obvious method for addressing online abuse: skilled moderation and the willingness to kick people off platforms for violating rules about abuse.
  - The biggest mistake we ever made with trolls was making the question of abuse about how to placate and fix [the trolls] instead of how to empower the people they hurt or manage your own well-being in the face of them.
