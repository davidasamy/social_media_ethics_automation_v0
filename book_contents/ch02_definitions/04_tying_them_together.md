# Tying It Together

Now that we have defined social media, ethics, and programming, we will spend the rest of this book tying them together in different ways.

To give one example, let's look at the experience of people who use social media but can't view images (they may be blind or low vision, or their device or internet might have restrictions). In order to make the information from the image accessible to these users, social media platforms allow images to be posted with an "alt text", which the user can read (or have the computer read to them). See {numref}`alt_text_fig` below for an example.

```{figure} alt_text_bigger.png
---
name: alt_text_fig
alt: 'a screenshot of a tweet by Kyle Thayer that has a photo. The tweet says: "We realized that some of our puzzles used the same mold, so now we can make combo dolphin / lighthouse puzzles! (Credit to artist Tim Klein who does this and I read about years ago: https://puzzlemontage.crevado.com)." The photo has the text "ALT" in the bottom left corner. The ALT button has been pressed, causing a popup to appear which shows the alt text: "Two circular puzzles one of a lighthouse and one of dolphins, except the pieces of a dolphin are swapped into place above the lighthouse."'

A [tweet](https://twitter.com/kylemthayer/status/1283516336845594624) with a photo that has an "alt text" (seen in the popup over the image), so those who cannot see the photo still have access to the information in the tweet.
```

Now, people who design and program social media platforms can do things to encourage or discourage users adding alt-text to their photos. For example, they could require or forbid users from adding alt-text to their photos, or they could do more subtle versions of those by putting reminders to add alt-text, or making the option of adding alt-text hard to find. Additionally, they could run a machine learning program to try to [automatically generate alt-text for photos](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/02/18/arts/alt-text-images-descriptions.html), though those programs may make mistakes or have biases.

So what are the ethical questions facing the designers and programmers of social media platforms? Are they responsible for designing their platforms around this accessibility issue, or is it the responsibility of users uploading image data to make their content accessible by using alt-text?

- Imagine a debate on this question between someone using the Aztec Virtue Ethics framework, and someone using the Natural Rights framework. Remember, each framework is a tool to help us see inside the problem. What would each tool show us?

- Aztec Virtue Ethics: Virtue is a group effort and we all need support to find balance and moderation, so it makes sense that users might need support from the platform's design to help them remember to add alt-text for those in their community who need to see it.
- Natural Rights: Every individual has the right to post how they see fit, for whichever audiences they choose. If they do not want to include alt-text (perhaps because they do not consider anyone who can't view images to be part of their community or audience), then that is their prerogative.

- Now imagine that you cannot decide between these perspectives, and suggest that we just let the platforms get the alt-text worked in when users are really ready for it. To this, a Taoist and a Consequentialist respond. What might they show us?

- Taoist: Trying to force this issue will likely backfire. Just leave things as they are, until the users are themselves asking for this option to be integrated into the platform's design.
- Consequentialist: Well SOME users already are asking for the integration; some are protesting it! I understand that some people will feel their freedoms have been interfered with if we make alt-text a very present part of the platform design, but if it gets us the good result that everyone can now participate fully with respect to viewing images, then surely it is worth the minor interference with the Natural Rights.
````

This is a small example of the kind of reflection that we will be returning to again and again throughout the course. As we get more deeply acquainted with the automation side of things, we will be able to use these ethical tools to look deeper into questions of Social Media, Ethics, and Automation.
