## Example: Social Media Connection Types

One difference you may notice with different social media sites is in how you form connections with others.
- Some social media sites don't have any formal connections. Like two users who happen to be in the same bulletin board.
- Some social media sites only allow reciprical connections, like being "friends" on Facebook
- Some social media sites offer one-way connections, like following someone on Twitter, or subscribing to a Youtube channel.
