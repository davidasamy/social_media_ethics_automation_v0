# Web 2.0 Social Media

In the first decade of the 2000s the way websites worked on the Internet went through a transition to what is called "[Web 2.0](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_2.0)."

In Web 2.0 websites (and web applications), the communication platforms and personal profiles merged. Many websites now let you create a profile, form connections, and participate in discussions with other members of the site. Platforms for hosting content without having to create your own website (like Blogs) emerged. And all of these websites became much more interactive, with updates appearing on users' screens without the user having to request them.

Let's look at some examples:

## Weblogs (Blogs)
In the mid 1990s, some internet users started manually adding regular updates to the top of their personal websites (leaving the old posts below), using their sites as an online diary, or a (web) log of their thoughts. In 1998/1999, several web platforms were launched to make it easy for people to create and update blogs (e.g., LiveJournal and Blogger.com).
